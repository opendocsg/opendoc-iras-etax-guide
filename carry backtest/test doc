### 1 Aim

### 1.1 This e-Tax Guide provides details on the carry-back relief system.

### 1.2 The e-Tax Guide is relevant to you if you have unabsorbed capital

### allowances^1 (“CA”) or unabsorbed trade losses from your trade,

### business, profession or vocation for the current year.

### 2 At a glance

### 2.1 The carry-back relief under section 37E of the Income Tax Act (“ITA”) is

### available to all persons carrying on a business, including sole-

### proprietorships and partnerships. The relief will be given only if a claim

### is made for it.

### 2.2 Under the system, a person may carry back its current year qualifying

### deductions (“QD”) and deduct them against its assessable income of the

## immediate preceding YA.

### 2.3 The maximum amount of QD that can be carried back is capped at

### $100,000.

### 2.4 The QD will be deducted in the following order:

### (i) current year’s unabsorbed CA, if any,

### (ii) current year’s trade losses, if any.

### 2.5 The carry-back of unabsorbed CA is subject to the “same business” test.

### A company will have to satisfy the shareholding test as well.

### 2.6 A company can elect to carry back its QD after transferring its loss items

### under the group relief system^2 , if applicable.

### 2.7 An individual can elect to carry back his QD after transferring the QD to

### his spouse^3 for the same YA, if applicable.

(^1) In this e-Tax guide, the term “capital allowances” refer to allowances given under sections
16, 17, 18B, 18C, 19, 19A, 19B, 19C, 19D or 20 of the ITA.
(^2) Please refer to IRAS e-Tax Guide on ‘Group Relief System’ issued on 6 Sep 2011.
(^3) The spousal transfer scheme is only applicable up to YA 2015. For more information on the
transitional arrangement, please refer to the e-Tax Guide on ‘Change to Assess the Income
of a Husband and Wife as Separate Individuals’ issued on 26 May 2014.


### 3 Glossary

### 3.1 Assessable income

### Assessable income of a company refers to its income from all sources

### after deducting CA, trade losses, approved donations (including those

### transferred from related companies under the group relief system) and

### other relevant deductions like incremental research and development

### expenses or investment allowances.

### Assessable income of an individual refers to the individual’s income from

### all sources after deducting CA, losses, and approved donations

### (including those transferred from spouse).

### 3.2 Immediate Preceding YA

### The immediate preceding YA refers to the YA immediately before the YA

### in which the person has trade losses or capital allowances available for

### carry back. For example, if the person incurred trade losses in year 201 7

### or is given capital allowances for YA 2018, the immediate preceding YA

### would be YA 201 7.

### 3.3 Loss items

### For group relief purposes, loss items refer to the unabsorbed CA, trade

### losses and donations for the current year that can be transferred by a

### company (“transferor company”) to another company of the group

### (“claimant company”).

### 3.4 Person

### Under section 2 of the ITA, a person includes a company, body of

### persons and a Hindu Joint Family.

### 3.5 Qualifying deductions (QD)

### For carry-back relief purposes, QD are the unabsorbed CA and

### unabsorbed trade losses for the current year.

### 3. 6 Relevant deductions

### A limited partner’s share of CA and trade losses from a limited liability

### partnership (“LLP”) or limited partnership (“LP”) allowed against the

### partner’s income from other sources.


### 3. 7 Same business test

### This test determines if a person continues to carry on the same trade,

### business, profession or vocation for which capital allowances are

### granted when carrying forward or back the unabsorbed capital

### allowances. The test is satisfied if the same trade, business, profession

### or vocation is continued.

### 3. 8 Shareholding test

### This test computes the percentage of the shareholdings of a company

### (or its ultimate parent company) that is held by the same persons as at

### the relevant dates. If the percentage is 50% or more, there is no

### substantial change in the shareholders and the company is said to have

### satisfied the shareholding test.

### Relevant dates for unabsorbed CA:

### First day of the YA in which the capital allowances were granted and the

### last day of the immediate preceding YA in which the capital allowances

### are to be deducted.

### Relevant dates for unabsorbed trade losses:

### First day of the year in which the trade losses were incurred and last day

### of the immediate preceding YA in which the trade losses are to be

### deducted.

### 3.9 Unabsorbed capital allowances (CA)

### The capital allowances claimed by a person (under section 16, 17, 18B,

### 18C, 19, 19A, 19B, 19C, 19D or 20 of the ITA) for a YA that exceed the

### person’s aggregate taxable income for that YA.

### 3.10 Unabsorbed trade losses

### The trade losses incurred by a person for a YA that exceed the person’s

### income from all sources for that YA.

### 3.11 Unabsorbed donations

### The approved donations made by a person in a YA that exceeds its

### statutory income for that YA. Approved donations are donations

### qualifying for tax deduction and made to recipients under sections 37(3)

### (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of the ITA.

### 4 Background

### 4.1 Before YA 2006, a person may carry forward its unabsorbed CA and

### trade losses to future YAs if it satisfies certain conditions under the ITA.


### 4.2 To help small businesses cope with cash-flow problems, especially in a

### cyclical downturn, a one year carry-back of QD was introduced from the

### YA 2006.

### 5 Carry-back relief system

### 5.1 Subject to conditions, the carry-back relief is available to you as a person

### who carries on a trade, business, profession or vocation. You may be :

### (a) a company;

### (b) an individual sole-proprietor or partner of a partnership, including

### an LLP and a LP;

### (c) a body of persons, such as clubs and associations; and

### (d) a trustee of trusts or executor of estates.

### 5.2 You may carry back the QD to the immediate preceding YA to be

### deducted from your assessable income of the immediate preceding YA

### in the order set out in paragraphs 6. 8 and 6. 9.

### 6 General Conditions Governing the Carry-Back Relief

### 6 .1 Your claim for carry-back relief is subject to the following general

### conditions:

### (a) Same business test

### 6.2 To qualify for carry-back relief, you must satisfy the same business test.

### This means that you will not be able to carry back the unabsorbed CA

### granted for the first basis period that you commenced a trade, business

### or profession. However, you can carry back the trade loss incurred for

### that period as the same business test does not apply to trade losses.

### To illustrate:

### During the basis period for YA 2018 that you commenced a business,

### you incurred a trade loss of $50,000 and had unabsorbed CA of $20,000.

### You could carry back the trade loss of $50,000 (but not the unabsorbed

### CA of $20,000) to be deducted against your assessable income for YA

### 2017.

### (b) Shareholding test

### 6.3 If you are a company, in addition to the same business test, you have to

### satisfy the shareholding test in order to carry back your QD.


### To illustrate:

### For YA 2018, your accounting period is 1 Jan 20 17 to 31 Dec 2017. You

### can carry back your QD for YA 20 18 to YA 2017 if your shareholders as

### at the following dates are substantially the same:

```
Carry
```
- back of
    Unabsorbed

```
CA
```
(^) Dates for comparison

### 1 Jan 20 18

### &

### 31 Dec

### 2017

### 1 st day of the YA in which the CA arose; &

### Last day of the YA in which the CA is utilised

```

(^) 1 Jan 20 17

### &

### 31 Dec

### 2017

### 1 st day of the year in which the loss was

### incurred; &

### Last day of the YA in which the loss is utilised

### 6.4 The Comptroller of Income Tax (“CIT”) may waive the shareholding test

### if it is satisfied that the substantial change in the shareholders is not for

### the purpose of deriving any tax benefit or obtaining any tax advantage.

### If the CIT grants the waiver, you can only deduct the QD against the

### income from the same trade or business for which the CA was granted

### or to which the trade loss relates.

### (c) Amount of Qualifying deductions to be carried back

### 6.5 The amount of QD that you can carry back is restricted to the lowest of:

### (i) your actual amount of the QD;

### (ii) your assessable income of the immediate preceding YA; and

### (iii) $100,000.

### 6.6 The excess that is not carried back can be carried forward for deduction

### against your future taxable income if you satisfy the same business test

### (and shareholding test if you are a company).

### To illustrate:

### Your assessable income for YA 2017

### = $60,

### Your QD for YA 2018 = $72,

### Amount of QD you can carry back to YA 2017 = $60,

### Excess that you can carry forward for deduction

### against future taxable income

### = $12,

### Annex A shows how to determine the amount of QD to be carried back.


### 6.7 If your functional currency is not S$, the exchange rate to use for the

### purpose of computing the cap of $100,000 is based on the exchange

### rate of the year in which the loss arose.

### To illustrate:

### Your functional currency is the US$.

### The exchange rate is 1.3833 for YA 2017 and 1.3749 for YA 2018.

### You incurred a trade loss of US$150,000 for the YA 2018.

### The amount of trade loss that you can carry back for deduction against

### your assessable income for YA 2017 is computed as follows:

### YA 2018

### US$

### Adjusted trade loss before carry back (150,000)

### Less: Loss carry back to YA 2017 72,733*

### Unabsorbed loss c/f (77,267)

### * S$100,000 / 1.

### YA 2017 YA 2017

### US$ S$

### Adjusted trade profit before carry back 300,000 414,990*

### Less: Loss carry back to YA 2017

### 72,

### 100,612#

### CI after loss carry-back

```
(before partial tax exemption)
```
### 227,

### 314,

### * S$300,000 x 1.

```
# S$72,733 x 1.
```
### (d) Order of Deduction

### 6.8 The QD carried back will be deducted from your assessable income of

### the immediate preceding YA in the following order:

### (a) current year unabsorbed CA, if any; and then

### (b) current year trade loss, if any.

### 6.9 If you have other income in addition to trade income, the unabsorbed CA

### and trade losses will be deducted against the other sources of income in

### the order as follows:

### 1 st : Income from same trade

### 2 nd : Income from other trade (proportionately if there is more than

### one other trade, business, profession or vocation)

### 3rd : Income from all other sources (proportionately if there is more

### than one other sources)


### 6.10 Where your QD exceed $100,000, and they arose from more than one

### trade, business, profession or vocation, the amount you can carry back

### for each of the trade, business, profession or vocation is also determined

### on a proportionate basis.

### Annex B provides examples on the order of deducting the QD carried

### back where there is more than:

### (i) one trade source; and

### (ii) one source of other income.

### 7 Carry- back relief under specific scenarios

### (a) Where income is taxed at concessionary rate

### 7.1 If you are a company with income chargeable to tax at the normal

### corporate tax rate, but your QD relate to income chargeable to tax at

### concessionary tax rate, the adjustment provided under section 37B of

### the ITA, (“adjustment factor”) has be applied for deduction across

### income chargeable under different tax rates.

### 7.2 In addition, the amount of QD (up to $100,000) is determined based on

### the following formula:

### A + B

### where A = any amount deducted against assessable income subject

### to tax at the normal corporate tax rate (currently 17%);

### B = any amount deducted against assessable income subject

### to tax at any concessionary rate of tax divided by the

### adjustment factor for that concessionary rate of tax;

### and

### the adjustment factor = Normal corporate tax divided by the

### Concessionary tax rate

### 7.3 Annex C is an example on the carry-back of QD for a company deriving

### income that is subject to tax at a concessionary rate.

### Annexes D1 and D2 give more examples on the carry-back of QD where

### there is income from more than one other trade, or more than one other

### source of income.

### (b) Where group relief is claimed

### 7.4 If you are a company which has elected for group relief, the amount of

### QD you can carry back is the net amount after deducting the loss items

### transferred out to the eligible claimant company or companies. Annex E

### illustrates how this is being done.

### 7.5 Annex F shows the order of deduction for companies at a glance.


### (c) Where transfer to spouse is made

### 7.6 The spousal transfer scheme has been phased out with effect from YA

### 2016. Any QD arising from YA 2016 (basis year 2015) onwards would

### no longer enjoy spousal transfer. However, under section 37E, you may

### continue to carry-back the QD to deduct against your assessable income

### of the immediate preceding YA. Annex G provides an illustration on how

### carry-back relief is effected for an individual and his spouse where

### transfer under section 37D is made prior to YA 2016.

### (d) Where the relief reduces personal reliefs

### 7.7 If you are an individual, you are entitled to the following personal reliefs

### based on your earned income for that YA:

### (a) earned income relief;

### (b) working mother child relief (for a married woman); and

### (c) deduction for CPF contributions by a self-employed.

### 7.8 As the QD carried back would reduce your earned income of the

### immediate preceding YA, your personal reliefs for the immediate

### preceding YA would have to be revised accordingly based on your

### revised earned income for that YA.

### (e) Where the relief is for limited partners of an LLP or a LP

### 7.9 If you are a limited partner of an LLP or a LP, your relevant deductions,

### together with all of your relevant deductions allowed in all past YAs, must

### not exceed your contributed capital as at the end of the basis period

### relating to that YA. This restriction is known as the “relevant deduction

### restriction^4 ”. Any excess of the relevant deductions over your contributed

### capital may then (subject to conditions) be carried forward to be

### deducted against your future share of income from the same LLP or LP.

### 7.10 The relevant deduction restriction also applies for the purpose of carry-

### back relief. Your capital contribution as at the end of the basis period

### relating to the YA that the QD arise will be used for the relevant deduction

### restriction. This is because your QD to be carried back relate to that YA

### and not the immediate preceding YA.

### 7.11 Annex H shows how the carry back deduction and restriction of the

### qualifying deductions are applied to partners of an LLP.

(^4) For an explanation of what is “contributed capital” and more details of the relevant deduction
restriction”, please refer to IRAS e-Tax Guide on “Income Tax Treatment of Limited Liability
Partnerships (Second Edition)” issued on 1 Mar 2014.


### 8 Specific exclusions for carry-back relief

### 8.1 You will not be able to carry back your QD if the QD arise from certain

### trade or activity carried on. They are:

### (a) Qualifying deductions of a trade where the income is wholly

### exempt from tax

### If you carry on such a trade (e.g. pioneer trade), you are not

### allowed to carry back the QD relating to that trade for deduction

### against other exempt or non-exempt income.

### (b) Qualifying deductions of specific activity or trade

### If you carry on specific types of activity or trade where there are

### rules restricting the deduction of the QD only against such trade

### or activity, or restricting the carry forward of the QD, you are to

### apply the same restriction in the carry back of the QD. The QD

### from such trade or activities are not allowed to be deducted

### against your other sources of income or your spouse’s income.

### These activities or trades include:

### (i) finance leasing where the income is taxable under section

### 10D of the ITA; and

### (ii) the business of hiring out motor cars where the income is

### taxable under section 10H of the ITA.

### (c) Qualifying deductions of a Section 10E company

### If you carry on a business of the making of investments, you are

### not allowed to carry forward your QD arising from that business.

### As the QD are disregarded, the carry- back relief does not apply.

### (d) Loss of eligible investors in approved start-up companies

### under the Enterprise Investment Incentive Scheme (EII)^5

### Currently, an eligible investor holding qualifying shares in

### approved start-up under the Enterprise Investment Incentive

### scheme (EII) may incur a capital loss upon:

### (i) the sale of its qualifying shares; or

### (ii) the liquidation of the approved start-up companies.

### As the loss is capital in nature, it does not qualify for carry- back

### relief.

in 2016]


### 9 Administrative requirements for the carry-back relief

### 9.1 If you wish to carry back the QD of any current YA to the immediate

### in the following tables:

### Election made before or at the time of filing the income tax return

```

the QD from a partnership/LLP/LP.
Partners of businesses,
regardless of the turnover
```
```
Not required, but to indicate in the election form, your
share of the QD to be carried back.
```
### 9.5 If you are a partner of a partnership/LLP/LP and have elected to carry

### back your share of the QD from the partnership/LLP/LP, you need not

### submit the financial accounts of the trade, business, profession or

### vocation carried on through the partnership/LLP/LP. However, you must,

### at the time of making the election, ensure that the precedent partner of

### the partnership/LLP/LP has already submitted to the CIT the following

### documents:

(^6) The prescribed election form is available at [http://www.iras.gov.sg.](http://www.iras.gov.sg.)


### (a) the certified statement of financial accounts; and

### (b) the tax computation showing your share of CA/loss from the

### partnership/LLP/LP.

### 9.6 The precedent partner may submit a set of provisional accounts and tax

### computation if the certified statement of financial accounts and tax

### computation are not finalised when the partner makes the election.

### 9.7 The CIT may treat the election as invalid if the precedent partner does

### not comply with the requirements.

### Election made after filing the income tax return

### 9.8 As an individual you may elect for the carry-back relief after filing your

### income tax return for the relevant current YA (but no later than 30 days

### on you). You only need to submit the completed and signed prescribed

### election form.

### Bodies of persons/trustees/executors making the election

### 9.9 Bodies of persons/trustees/executors may elect for the carry-back relief

### by submitting the completed and signed prescribed election form,

### together with a provisional/finalised set of tax computation and financial

### accounts for the current YA and the revised tax computation for the

### immediate preceding YA (no later than the time of filing the income tax

### return for the current YA).

### 10 Refund of excess tax

### 10.1 Where there is tax to be refunded from the carry-back of the QD, the CIT

### will refund the amount within 3 months from the date you (or together

### with your spouse) make the election. If there is any tax owing for the

### other tax types (e.g. property tax), the amount of tax to be refunded to

### you is the net amount after deducting your other outstanding tax

### liabilities.

### 11 Time limit for CIT to raise additional assessments

### 11.1 If the CIT discovers that the amount of QD carried back and deducted

### against your assessable income of any immediate preceding YA was

### excessive, the CIT would make an assessment on the amount which

### should be charged to tax within 5 years after the end of that YA.


### 11.2 To illustrate:

### Example 1

### You have carried back your trade loss of $ 8 0,000 for YA 20 18 to be

### deducted against your assessable income for YA 2017. The trade loss

### is subsequently reduced to $57,000. CIT may:

### (a) revise the assessment for YA 20 18 (to reduce the amount of the

### loss); and

### (b) raise an additional assessment for YA 2017 (in respect of $23,

### over allowed) by 31 Dec 2022.

Note:

1. As Mr Tan has elected for carry-back relief, the full amount of $100,000 must be carried back even though
    he has $1 3 ,000 personal reliefs to deduct from his assessable income of $103,000.
2. Computation of earned income relief:

```
(a) Based on the order of deduction, the loss carried back of $100,000 will be deducted from trade income
of $42,000 first. The balance of loss carried back of $58,000 [i.e. $100,000 - $42,000] will be deducted
proportionately between the employment income ($40,000) and rental income ($21,000).
```
```
(b) Loss of $58,000 attributable to employment income = $58,000 x $40,000 / $61,000 = $38,033
```
```
(c) Employment income net of loss carried back = $40,000 - $38,033 = $1,967
