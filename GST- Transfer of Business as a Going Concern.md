# GST: Transfer of Business as a Going Concern and other Excluded Transactions (Third Edition)


## 1 Aim

1.1 This e-Tax Guide[^1] explains and provides examples of transactions that are
regarded as neither a supply of goods nor services and hence are not subject
to GST.

[^1]: This e-Tax guide is a consolidation of two previous e-Tax guides:
a) GST: “Transfer of business as a going concern” published on 29 Feb 2008.
b) “Goods and Services Tax Treatment of Transfer for a Consideration of “Qualifying Deductions”
allowed under the Income Tax Group Relief System” published on 16 July 2003.

1.2 You should read this guide if you are:


>(a) Transferring your business as a going concern; or

>(b) Transferring or assigning the title to the goods comprised in a hire
purchase agreement when you assign your right to receive payments
(as a financier) under the agreement to another financier; or

>(c) Transferring qualifying income tax deductions to another company
belonging to the same group of companies as you.

## 2 At a Glance

2.1 All taxable supplies made by a GST-registered person are subject to GST.
However, certain transactions are specifically disregarded as supplies under
the Goods and Services Tax (Excluded Transactions) Order and are not
subject to GST. These transactions (“excluded transactions”) are:

>(a) The transfer of assets made under an agreement for the transfer of
business as a going concern (referred to in this guide as TOGC);

>(b) The transfer or assignment of title to goods comprised in a hire-
purchase agreement; or

>(c) The transfer of any qualifying deductions under section 37C of the
Income Tax Act.

2.2 In the case of a TOGC, this guide primarily sets out:

>(a) The conditions for the supply of assets transferred to be treated as an
excluded transaction (“TOGC conditions” elaborated under paragraph
4);

>(b) The GST treatment for the recovery of input tax in relation to a TOGC
(paragraph 7);

>(c) The GST treatment for the repayment of input tax deemed deducted
when the transferee (new owner) changes or intends to change the
usage of the transferred assets (paragraph 9); and


>(d) The GST obligations of the transferor (previous owner) and the
transferee (paragraph 10).

2.3 A taxable person who transfers or disposes the assets of his business,
whether or not for a consideration[^2] , will have to account for GST on such
transfer or disposal unless he satisfies all the TOGC conditions.

[^2]: If input tax has been allowed on the assets, the taxable person will have to account for output tax even if the assets are transferred without consideration.


## 3 Glossary

### 3.1 Consideration

Consideration refers to any payment, whether monetary or non-monetary,
made in return for goods or services provided. Non-monetary payments would
include any benefit in kind that possesses commercial value.

### 3.2 Excluded transaction

An excluded transaction is a transaction that is not treated as a supply for GST
purposes under the GST (Excluded Transactions) Order.

### 3.3 Exempt supply

An exempt supply is a supply that is not subject to GST under the Fourth
Schedule to the GST Act. Such supplies comprise the provision of financial
services, the sale and lease of residential properties and the supply of
investment precious metals (IPM).

### 3.4 Supply

A supply refers to anything that is done for a consideration[^3]. Hence, the
provision of any goods or services (including the grant, assignment or
surrender of any right) in return for a consideration is a supply.

### 3.5 Taxable person

A person who is or is required to be registered for GST.

### 3.6 Taxable supply

A taxable supply is a supply of goods and services made in Singapore other
than an exempt supply.

### 3.7 TOGC

An acronym for Transfer Of Business as a Going Concern.

[^3]: Section 10(2) of the GST Act provides that “supply” includes “all forms of supply, but not anything done otherwise than for a consideration”.


## 4 Supply of Assets under a Transfer of Business

4.1 A supply of assets made under an agreement for the transfer of business is
treated as an excluded transaction if it satisfies all the conditions listed below [^4]:

> **(a) The supply of assets is made in relation to a transfer of the
business (or part of that business) to the transferee.**

> A mere transfer of the assets will not qualify as a transfer of business.
The transfer must have the effect of putting the transferee in
possession of a business[^5]. In general, a person is in possession of a
“business” if he carries on continuous activities that are mainly
concerned with making supplies to his customers for a consideration.

> <ins>Example:</ins> The transferee is generally in possession of a business when
he takes over the business assets and liabilities such as goodwill,
premises, fixture & fittings, staff, on-going contracts (e.g. tenancy,
maintenance) and outstanding debts and taxes.

>This condition can still be satisfied even if the transfer of assets to him
occurs in phases or on different dates. This is provided that there are
valid and genuine commercial reasons for doing so [^6].

> <ins>Example:</ins> The transferee is unable to obtain regulatory clearance on
the transfer of product registration license on time to operate the
transferred business on the transfer date. Both parties signed an
agency agreement with the following terms:

> - the transferor is to operate the business as an agent, on behalf
of the transferee before the transfer of license is effected;

> - the transferor is to cease operating the business immediately
after the license is successfully transferred to the transferee;

> - the transferor is to keep separate records of the transferred
business on behalf of the transferee until the license is
transferred.

[^4]: Paragraph 2 of the GST (Excluded Transactions) Order

[^5]: More details on the term “business” can be found in the e-Tax Guide “GST: Guide on Non-Business
Receipts – Business Tests and the Effect of Non-Business Receipts on Input Tax Claims”, which is available
on [http://www.iras.gov.sg](http://www.iras.gov.sg) > Quick Links > e-Tax Guides > GST.

[^6]: The Comptroller will assess each case based on the validity of the commercial reason(s) and strength
of all material facts furnished.

> ** (b) The assets to be transferred must be intended for use by the
transferee in carrying on the same kind of business as the
transferor.**

> The transferor is required to verify the transferee’s intention with regard
to the use of the transferred assets. The transferee’s intention may be indicated in documents such as the business contract or sale and purchase agreement. If such documents are not available, the
transferor may request for a written confirmation from the transferee. Where the transferee intends to use the assets to carry out a different kind of business, the transferor must charge GST on the supply of assets.

> The Comptroller does not impose a minimum timeframe in which the transferee must continue to operate the transferred business in order to satisfy this condition. This is because the Comptroller understands that this timeframe can vary, depending on the type of business carried on and various economic factors.

> The transferee also need not be engaged in the same kind of business as the transferor prior to the transfer.

> <ins>Example:</ins> An electronics company diversifies its business by acquiring a restaurant chain.

> **(c) In the case where only part of the business is transferred, that part
must be capable of being operated independently.**

> It is irrelevant whether the transferee operates the part business together with or separately from his other businesses.

> **(d) The business (or part of that business) must be a going concern
at the time of the transfer. **

> There must not be any closure of the business immediately after the
transfer, except for temporary closure necessary to prepare the
business for operation under the new ownership.

> The business or part business can be a going concern even if it is
unprofitable or trading under the control of a judicial manager or
receiver.

> <ins>Example:</ins> A company acquires and revives a dying or mismanaged
business.

> **(e) The transferee must already be a taxable person or immediately
becomes a taxable person as a result of the transfer.**

> The transferee must be GST registered at the time of transfer or where
he is not, he immediately becomes a taxable person as a result of the
transfer. The transferee is liable to be GST-registered if the value of
his taxable supplies exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed $
million immediately after the transfer. In such an instance, the GST
registration of the transferee shall be backdated to the date of the
transfer.

4.2 Where the transferee belongs to a group of companies that is registered for
GST as a group under section 30 of the GST Act[^7] , at least one of the following
conditions must also be satisfied before the transfer of business can qualify
as an excluded transaction[^8] :

> (a) The members of the group are entitled to input tax credit in full on
supplies made to them and importations made by them. When
determining the entitlement to input tax credits, the members
should also take into account the adjustments mentioned in our
e- Tax Guide, “GST: Partially Exempt Traders and Input Tax
Recovery;

> (b) The assets to be transferred are held by the transferor for more
than 3 years; or

>(c) The transferor is not entitled to any input tax credit on the assets
to be transferred.

4.3 When the supply of assets satisfies the conditions in paragraphs 4 .1 and 4 .2,
the transferor may treat the supply as an excluded transaction without the
need to seek approval from the Comptroller. The transferor will not need to
charge and account for GST on the excluded transactions.

4.4 When the supply of assets fails to qualify as an excluded transaction but is
made between members of the same GST group registration (i.e. both
transferor and transferee are part of the same GST group), the supply shall
still be disregarded under section 30 of the GST Act[^9]. In other words,
transferor will not need to charge and account for GST on the supply.

## 5 Examples of Excluded Transactions

### Transfer of a property rental business

5.1 Company A is a GST-registered business that owns several non-residential
properties. A derives rental income from leasing out these properties.
Company B is also a GST-registered business and is not a member of any
GST group under section 30 of the GST Act.

5.2 A enters into an agreement with B to sell one of its non-residential properties,
a commercial building. The terms of the sale and purchase agreement include
the following:

> (a) the sale of the building includes existing plant, equipment, fixtures and
fittings owned by A;

[^7]: Please refer to the e-Tax guide on “GST: General Guide on Group Registration”, which is available on
[http://www.iras.gov.sg](http://www.iras.gov.sg) > Quick Links > e-Tax Guides > GST, for more information.

[^8]: Paragraph 3 of the GST (Excluded Transactions) Order

[^9]:  Members under the same GST group registration are treated as a single entity and supplies made between the members are disregarded.


> (b) B undertakes to continue the property leasing business after the
transfer;

> (c) All the units in the property will be transferred to B;

> (d) the existing occupation agreement (tenancy and license) including
rental, fee and security deposits collected will be transferred to B. B
will discharge and fulfill all obligations of A under the original tenancy
and license agreements;

> (e) the building maintenance contracts will either be assigned or novated
to B. B will take over the deposits (cash and guarantee) and refund the
deposits to service providers in accordance to contractual terms;

> (f) the sale includes works-in-progress such as upgrading of lifts. B will
take over the contractual obligations and be responsible for making
payment or refunding deposits to the relevant service providers; and

> (g) B is liable to pay property tax on the property transferred.

5.3 By taking over the entire building together with the existing tenancy and
licensing agreements, security deposits, building maintenance and works
contracts, B is in possession of the property leasing business. As B derives
rental income from existing tenancy and licensing agreements after the
transfer, B is carrying on the same kind of business as A. Since B is also able
to satisfy all other qualifying conditions (e.g. B is GST-registered on the date
of transfer), the transfer of property rental business from A to B qualifies as an
excluded transaction.

5.4 Where the transaction qualifies as an excluded transaction and B is a public-
listed Real Estate Investment Trust (S-REIT) or the Special Purpose Vehicle
(SPV) of a S-REIT, self-accounting of GST for the property purchase will not
apply since no GST is chargeable.


### Transfer of business operations without transfer of premises

5.5 Company C’s principal activities are those relating to manufacturing. As part
of business restructuring, C intends to transfer its manufacturing operations to
related Company D. C retains the ownership of the manufacturing plant and
will only derive rental income from the lease of the plant. D will take over all
licenses, intellectual properties, customer contracts, supplier contracts,
employees and plant and equipment related to the manufacturing operations.

5.6 The fact that the business premises are not transferred does not affect D from
taking over the business in its entirety. It is not necessary for D to own the
manufacturing plant to operate a manufacturing business. As such, the
transfer of the manufacturing operations can qualify as an excluded
transaction.

### Transfer of assets to a new legal entity

5.7 A transfer of business can arise from a pure change of legal constitution of the
entity. Law firm E is a GST registered partnership business. E’s existing
partners decided to convert the partnership business into a limited liability
partnership (LLP). On the transfer date, the LLP becomes GST registered,
takes over E’s assets and liabilities and continues to operate the same
business.

5.8 The above transfer qualifies as an excluded transaction as all the business’
assets, operations and processes are passed over and continued in the same
manner by a new GST-registered entity.

### Amalgamation

5.9 Company F and its related Company G intend to enter into a voluntary
amalgamation. Under the amalgamation, F and G would be combined into a
single legal entity where F would be the surviving entity and the business of
G would be subsumed under F.

5.10 Notwithstanding that there is no actual sale of business from G to F, the effect
of the amalgamation is that the entire business of G would be transferred as
a going concern to F. All assets and liabilities are transferred to F and F would
carry on G’s business in addition to its existing business.

### Transfer of assets over time

5.11 Company H plans to transfer its business to a related company, Company J.
The assets of its business are deemed transferred to J as of the business
transfer date. However, a few of its customer contracts can only be transferred
to J at a later date due to delay in obtaining the customers’ consent to novate
the contracts. In addition, due to operational reasons, the transfer of
employees would take place at a later date.

5.12 Nonetheless, the transfer of the contracts and assets are provided for under
one agreement and the intention is for J to take over the business from H with
effect from the business transfer date. The transfer can still qualify as an
excluded transaction.

## 6 Examples of Non-excluded Transactions

### Transfer of Shares

6.1 Where the shares of a limited company are transferred from one person to
another, there is no TOGC as the assets still belong to the limited company
(i.e. no change in the ownership of assets).

### Carrying on a Different Business

6.2 Company K, a property leasing business sells the retail space that it owns to
Company L. Company L intends to use the retail space to expand its fashion
retail business. As L is not using the property to carry on the same kind of
business as K, the sale does not qualify as a TOGC.

### Consecutive transfers of assets

6.3 Companies M, N, O are all taxable persons. M is in the business of property
leasing. M sells its properties to N which immediately sub-sells the properties
to O. Both sales are completed with the transfer of title to the properties from
M to O. The sale of the properties by M to N and then immediately from N to
O would not qualify as excluded transactions. As N does not use the properties
to carry on the same property leasing business as M, the transfer of properties
does not qualify as a TOGC.

## 7 Claiming Input Tax on TOGC Expenses

7.1 The transferor or the transferee can claim input tax for the GST that he incurs
on expenses relating to the TOGC (“TOGC expenses”), provided that the
expenses are:

> (a) attributable to his taxable supplies or out-of-scope supplies which
would be taxable if made in Singapore;

> (b) supported by valid tax invoices; and

> (c) are not disallowed under regulations 26 and 27 of the GST (General)
Regulations[^10]

7.2 Some examples of TOGC expenses are professional fees paid by the
transferee to conduct due diligence on the transferred business, and the legal
fees paid by the transferor to draft the transfer agreement.

### Transferee

7.3 If the transferee acquires assets by way of an excluded transaction and the
assets are to be used exclusively to make taxable supplies, the GST incurred
on the TOGC expenses can be recovered in full. Conversely, if the assets of
the acquired business are to be used exclusively to make exempt supplies,
none of the input tax on the expenses attributable to the TOGC can be
recovered. If the assets are to be used in making both taxable and exempt
supplies, the input tax incurred on the TOGC expenses must be apportioned
in accordance with the partial exemption method applicable to the
transferee[^11].

[^10]: They are namely (a) club subscription fee, (b) medical and accident insurance premium, (c) medical expenses; (d) family benefits, (e) transactions involving betting sweepstakes, lotteries, fruit machines or games of chances; and (f) expenses relating to motor cars.

[^11]: Please refer to the e-Tax guide on “GST: Partially Exempt Traders and Input Tax Recovery”, which
is available from [http://www.iras.gov.sg](http://www.iras.gov.sg) > Quick Links > e-Tax Guides > GST, for more information.

### Transferor

7.4 If the transferor sells his assets and the transaction qualifies as an excluded
transaction, the GST incurred on the TOGC expenses may be treated as the
general overheads of the transferor. Accordingly, the input tax on such
expenses is claimable as input tax of the transferor, subject to the input tax
attribution rules applicable to his business.

## 8 Transitional Issues


### Purchases in the name of the transferor relating to periods after the transfer

8.1 During the <ins>transitional</ins> period of the business transfer, the transferee may
receive tax invoices, import permits or shipping documents that are addressed
to the transferor. Administratively, the Comptroller will allow the transferee to
claim input tax on these purchases provided all of the following conditions are
satisfied:

> (a) The transferor undertakes in writing that he will not claim input tax on
the purchases. The transferee will maintain this undertaking from the
transferor for record-keeping purposes;

> (b) The transferee has notified all suppliers of the change in business
ownership;

> (c) The transferee will pay for the purchases and maintain evidence of the
payment;

> (d) The purchases are for the transferee’s business and are used or to be
used for the making of taxable supplies or out-of-scope supplies (which
are taxable if made in Singapore) and are not disallowed under
regulations 26 and 27; and

> (e) The transferee has taken over all rights and liabilities pertaining to the
purchases.

8.2 The transitional period refers to a period not more than 6 months from the
transfer date. For example, if the transfer date was 01 Apr 20 13 , the transferee
may claim input tax on tax invoices issued to the transferor that are dated up
till 30 Sep 2013.


## 9 Repayment of Input Tax Deemed Deducted for TOGC


### What is this section about?

9.1 In a TOGC, the transferee is deemed to have incurred and deducted input tax
credits on the value of supply of the transferred assets. This section explains
the circumstances where the transferee is required to repay to the Comptroller
such input tax deemed deducted.

9.2 For the purpose of this section, the following terms are used.

|||
| - | - |
| Date of Transfer   | Date of transfer of assets under TOGC |
| The Change         | Refers to the situation where the transferee changes or forms an intention to change the usage of the transferred assets                               |
| Date of Change     | Refers to the date where transferee changes or forms an intention to change the usage of the transferred assets                                        |
| The 2nd Change     | Refers to the situation where the transferee subsequently changes or forms an intention to change the usage of the transferred assets after The Change |
| Date of 2nd Change | Refers to the subsequent date where transferee changes or forms an intention to change the usage of the transferred assets after the Date of Change    |

### When is repayment required?

9.3 Generally, the Comptroller will require repayment of input tax deemed
deducted on the assets transferred when[^12] :

>(a) There is a distinct change in the activities of the acquired business by
the transferee;

>(b) The change in the business activities resulted in a **change in usage of the acquired assets** in any one of the four circumstances below:

[^12]: Regulation 38 of GST (General) Regulations

| No. | Assets transferred are used in carrying on the same kind of business as that carried on by the transferor in making | & | during a period of 5 years after date of transfer of assets, transferee uses or forms an intention to use the assets in making |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1 | Taxable supplies | to | Exempt supplies |
| 2 | Taxable supplies | to | Both taxable and exempt supplies |
| 3 | Both taxable and exempt supplies | to | Exempt supplies |
| 4 | Both taxable and exempt supplies | to | Both taxable and exempt supplies,but the proportion of taxable supplies to exempt supplies reduces |

> (c) This change occurs within **5 years** after the Date of Transfer.

### What is the amount of input tax deemed deducted?

9.4 The input tax deemed deducted is the input tax that would have been incurred had the transfer of assets not qualified as an excluded transaction.

```
Input tax deemed deducted 
= GST rate at the Date of Transfer 
x Value of assets transferred as at date of transfer
```

### What is the amount to be repaid?

9.5 The amount of input tax to be repaid to the Comptroller should be derived
using the formula below:

```
Input tax to be repaid
= Input tax deemed deducted
x Change in ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies
x Remaining number of accounting periods
÷ Total number of accounting periods in 5 years
```
<table >
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Change in ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><ins>For 1st adjustment</ins></p>
<p style="border: 1px solid black;">1 - Ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies in the accounting period in which The Change occurs</p>
<p><ins>For subsequent adjustment</ins></p>
<p style="border: 1px solid black;">Ratio of taxable supplies to the total supplies in the accounting period in which The Change occurs - Ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies in the account period in which The 2<sup>nd</sup> Change occurs&nbsp;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;
<p>Remaining number of accounting periods</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><ins>For 1st adjustment</ins></p>
<p>Total number of accounting periods in 5 years less number of accounting periods from the Date of Transfer to the Date of Change (Inclusive of both dates).</p>
<p><ins>For subsequent adjustment</ins></p>
<p>Total number of accounting periods in 5 years less number of accounting periods from the Date of Transfer to the Date of 2nd Change (Inclusive of both dates).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### How should repayment be made?

9.6 The transferee should repay the input tax in the accounting period in which the change in use of the asset occurs or when the intention is formed. The amount to be repaid should be deducted from Box 7 (Input tax and refund claims) of the GST return.

9.7 An example of repayment of input tax deemed deducted is provided in Appendix 1.

### When is repayment NOT required?

9.8 Repayment of input tax is not required when the reduction in the proportion of taxable supplies to exempt supplies is due to normal fluctuation of business transactions.

9.9 However, where such reduction in the proportion of taxable supplies to exempt supplies is not due to normal fluctuation of business, repayment of input tax will be required as explained in paragraph 9. 3 above.

## 10 Record-Keeping

10.1 Under section 46 of the GST Act, GST-registered persons are required to keep their business records for 5 years from the end of the prescribed accounting period.

10.2 In the case of a TOGC, both the transferor and transferee must maintain proper records on the transferred assets. Records to be kept should include information on the assets’ description and value. Both parties must also be able to reconcile the difference (if any) in the value of the transferred assets immediately before and after the transfer.

10.3 In addition, the transferor is required to hand over to the transferee any records of the transferred business that are required to be kept for GST purposes. The transferee takes over the obligation to keep and preserve business records on the date of transfer of business.


10.4 If the transferor wishes to retain records of the transferred business, he is required to seek approval from the Comptroller under section 34(b) of the GST Act. Generally, the Comptroller is prepared to waive the transferee’s requirement to maintain records and allow the transferor to maintain the records instead if:

> (a) It involves a partial transfer of business. The transferor needs the
records to fulfil other regulatory requirements, such as filing income tax
returns;

> (b) It involves a partial transfer of business. The transferor has difficulties segregating the records, as the records relate to both the transferred
business and the transferor’s remaining business; or

> (c) The transferor is involved in a legal suit and records are required to be
admitted as evidence in court.

10.5 The transferor is required to write to the Comptroller to seek approval. The
written request must contain a brief description of the transfer and the
reason(s) for wanting to maintain the records. In addition, both the transferor
and transferee must jointly undertake[^13] to do the following:

> (i) Upon request by the Comptroller, the transferee will obtain any
information and make available any business and accounting records
from the transferor that relate to the transferred business;

> (ii) The transferor will make available to the transferee all records or
information that relate to the transferred business, so as to enable the
transferee to comply with subparagraph (i) above;

> (iii) The transferor will preserve all relevant business records and adhere
to any other statutory duties provided under Section 46 of the GST Act;
and

> (iv) The transferor will notify the Comptroller of its intention to cease its
remaining businesses, within 30 days from the date such an intention
is formed, and hand over to the transferee all records in its possession
that relate to the transferred business.

10.6 The transferor must provide a copy of the joint undertaking each to the
Comptroller upon his request and the transferee for retention.

[^13]: The principal officers of transferor and transferee are required to sign the joint undertaking.

## 11 Other Excluded Transactions: Transfer of Title to Goods in Hire-purchase Agreement

11.1 In a hire purchase agreement, a financier makes two supplies:

> (a) A taxable supply of goods to the customer; and

> (b) An exempt supply of services from the provision of instalment credit
facility

11.2 After concluding the hire-purchase transaction with his customer, the financier may transfer his rights under the hire-purchase agreement to another financier to continue providing financing to the customer. The title of the goods under the hire-purchase will then be transferred to the second financier.

11.3 As the supply of goods had already been made by the first financier to the hirer at the onset, the subsequent transfer of the goods by the first financier to the second financier is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services. Hence, GST is not chargeable on the transfer.

## 12 Other Excluded Transactions: Transfer of Qualifying Income Tax Deductions

### Background on section 37C of the Income Tax Act

12.1 For income tax purposes, with effect from the year of assessment (“YA”) 2003, a company (“transferor company”) belonging to a group may transfer any “qualifying deductions” to another company (“claimant company”) of the same group. “Qualifying deductions” under section 37C(14) of the Income Tax Act (“ITA”) refers to the current year unabsorbed capital allowances, current year unabsorbed trade losses and current year unabsorbed donations that may be transferred to be deducted against the assessable income of the claimant
company under the income tax group relief system (“group relief system”) [^14].

### General GST treatment of transfer of qualifying deduction

12.2 The “qualifying deductions” are assets of the transferor company. These
assets have a value as the “qualifying deductions” may be carried forward and
used to be deducted against future profits of the company for income tax
purposes. With the implementation of the group relief system, the “qualifying
deductions” would still be of value when they are transferred out to another
company in the same group for a consideration, to be used by the claimant
company as a deduction against its own taxable profits.

12.3 Thus, the transfer of “qualifying deductions” is no different from the transfer of
any other business asset for a consideration. In other words, the transfer of
“qualifying deductions” in return for consideration would constitute a taxable
supply of services under section 10(2)(b) of the GST Act[^15].

[^14]: Please refer to the e-Tax guide on “Group Relief System”, which is available from
[http://www.iras.gov.sg](http://www.iras.gov.sg) > Quick Links > e-Tax Guides > GST, for more information.

[^15]: Section 10(2)(b) of the GST Act provides that anything which is not a supply of goods but is done for a
consideration (including, if so done, the granting, assignment or surrender of any right) is a supply of
services.


### “Qualifying Deductions” to be treated as excluded transactions

12.4 In order not to negate the original intended benefits of the group relief system,
which is to encourage risk taking and enterprise, the transfer of “qualifying
deductions” under the group relief system has been classified as an excluded
transaction. This treatment will apply to transfers of “qualifying deductions”
made from the effective date of the group relief system.

12.5 Where the claimant company supplies services to the transferor company in
return for the transfer of “qualifying deductions”, the transferor company need
not account for GST on the transfer. Although the transferor company receives
consideration from the claimant company in the form of the services supplied
by the latter, as the transfer qualifies as an excluded transaction, no GST is
chargeable. However, the claimant company (if it is GST registered) would
have to account for GST on its supply of services as it has received non-
monetary consideration in the form of the “qualifying deductions”.

### Input tax claim in respect of transfer of “qualifying deductions”

12.6 Where the claimant company is a GST-registered person and incurs input tax
for the purpose of acquiring the “qualifying deductions”[^16] , it will not be able to
claim the input tax. This is because the “qualifying deductions” are not used
to make taxable supplies subsequently.

## 13 Other Excluded Transactions: Issue of Carbon Credits

13.1 Under the Carbon Pricing Act which came into operation on 1 Jan 2019, a
carbon tax will be imposed on a business whose emission of greenhouse
gases (GHG) over a period of time has exceeded a stipulated emission
threshold. The business will be required to purchase carbon credits from the
National Environment Agency (NEA) to cover its carbon tax liability.

13.2 As the purpose of the carbon credits is to control emissions in Singapore by
discouraging businesses from emitting GHG at their current levels, and to
align the GST treatment with other non-taxable Government supplies [^17], the
issue of carbon credits by NEA has been treated as an excluded transaction
for which GST is not chargeable.

[^16]: For example, input tax incurred in respect of consultancy or accounting services for the purposes of
acquiring the “qualifying deductions”.

[^17]: For example, charges under the Electronic Road Pricing system and Certificates of Entitlement.

## 14 Frequently Asked Questions

**14.1 Can I collect GST on an excluded transaction?**

An excluded transaction is neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services. Hence, it is not subject to GST. If your transaction qualifies as an excluded transaction, you cannot collect GST on the transaction.



**14.2 Do I need to issue a tax invoice for an excluded transaction?**

You need not issue a tax invoice for an excluded transaction. Instead, you
may issue other forms of billing documents (e.g. commercial invoice).
However, if you choose to issue a tax invoice for your excluded transaction,
you need to indicate that the transaction is neither a supply of goods nor
services for GST purposes.

**14.3 Do I need to report the value of my assets transferred under TOGC in my GST return?**

For assets transferred under TOGC, you are not required to report the value
in your GST return as the transfer is neither a supply of goods nor services.

**14.4 I am not GST-registered. When I acquire a business from a GST-registered person, do I have to register for GST as a result of the acquisition?**

If a business was transferred to you, you have to include the taxable turnover
of the transferor to determine your liability to register for GST.

For transfers of business taking place before 1 Jan 2019, you are liable to
register if the total of your taxable turnover and your transferor’s taxable
turnover for the quarter of transfer and the past 3 quarters exceeds $1 million.

For transfers of business taking place on or after 1 Jan 2019, you are liable to
register if the total of your taxable turnover and your transferor’s taxable
turnover is more than $1 million at the end of the previous calendar year.

If you are liable for registration, your date of GST registration will be from the
date of transfer. However, if you are certain[^18] that your taxable turnover for
the next 12 months will not exceed $1 million, you will not be liable for GST
registration.

## Annex A - Worked example for repayment of input tax

Company A transferred its general insurance business to Company B on 04 Apr 2010. The only asset transferred was the office building valued at $1 million on the Date of Transfer. Company B acquired the assets to carry on the same general insurance business carried on by Company A prior to the transfer. Assume that the transfer qualifies as an excluded transaction.

Company B subsequently obtains a life insurance license from MAS on 06 Jun 2013. Company B continues to use the assets to carry on its life insurance
business.

**Company B's supplies**

| Accounting period | 1/4/10 – 30/06/10 | 1/04/13 – 30/6/13 |
|-|-|-|
| Value of taxable supplies| $1,500,000 |$ 100,000 |
| Value of exempt supplies | $ 150,000 | $1,900,000 |
| Value of total supplies | $1,650,000 | $2,000,000 |
| Proportion of taxable supplies to exempt supplies | 10.00 |0.05 |

There is a distinct change in business activities on 06 Jun 2013, which is within 5 years after the date of transfer of the assets on 04 Apr 2010. This change in business activities results in a change in use of assets such that there is a reduction in the proportion of taxable supplies to exempt supplies. Company B is required to repay input tax deemed incurred and deducted on the assets transferred.

The computation of the input tax repayable is computed below.

|Variable|Computation|
|-|-|
| Amount of input tax deemed deducted | GST rate x Value of assets<br>= 7% x $1m<br>= $70,000 |
| Change in ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies | 1 – ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies in the accounting period in which The Change occurs<br> = 1 – (100,000/2,000,000)<br>= 0.95 |
| Remaining number of accounting periods | Total number of accounting periods in 5 years – number of accounting periods from the Date of Transfer to the Date of Change (inclusive of both dates)<br>= (5 x 4) – 13<br>= 7 |
| Amount of input tax to be repaid | Input tax to be repaid <br>= Input tax deemed deducted<br>x Change inratio of taxable supplies to total supplies<br>x Remaining number of accounting periods<br>÷ Total number of accounting periods in 5 years<br>= $70,000 x 0.95 x 7 ÷ 20<br>= $23,275.00 |
| How the input tax should be repaid | Company B should deduct the amount of $23,275.00 from Box 7 (Input tax and refund claims) of the GST return for the period ended 30 Jun 2013. |
