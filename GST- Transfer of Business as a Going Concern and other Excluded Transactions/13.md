# 13. Other Excluded Transactions: Issue of Carbon Credits

13.1 Under the Carbon Pricing Act which came into operation on 1 Jan 2019, a
carbon tax will be imposed on a business whose emission of greenhouse
gases (GHG) over a period of time has exceeded a stipulated emission
threshold. The business will be required to purchase carbon credits from the
National Environment Agency (NEA) to cover its carbon tax liability.

13.2 As the purpose of the carbon credits is to control emissions in Singapore by
discouraging businesses from emitting GHG at their current levels, and to
align the GST treatment with other non-taxable Government supplies [^17], the
issue of carbon credits by NEA has been treated as an excluded transaction
for which GST is not chargeable.

[^17]: For example, charges under the Electronic Road Pricing system and Certificates of Entitlement.
