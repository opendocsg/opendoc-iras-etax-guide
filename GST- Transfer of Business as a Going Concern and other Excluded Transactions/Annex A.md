# Annex A - Worked example for repayment of input tax

Company A transferred its general insurance business to Company B on 04 Apr 2010. The only asset transferred was the office building valued at $1 million on the Date of Transfer. Company B acquired the assets to carry on the same general insurance business carried on by Company A prior to the transfer. Assume that the transfer qualifies as an excluded transaction.

Company B subsequently obtains a life insurance license from MAS on 06 Jun 2013. Company B continues to use the assets to carry on its life insurance
business.

**Company B's supplies**

| Accounting period | 1/4/10 – 30/06/10 | 1/04/13 – 30/6/13 |
|-|-|-|
| Value of taxable supplies| $1,500,000 |$ 100,000 |
| Value of exempt supplies | $ 150,000 | $1,900,000 |
| Value of total supplies | $1,650,000 | $2,000,000 |
| Proportion of taxable supplies to exempt supplies | 10.00 |0.05 |

There is a distinct change in business activities on 06 Jun 2013, which is within 5 years after the date of transfer of the assets on 04 Apr 2010. This change in business activities results in a change in use of assets such that there is a reduction in the proportion of taxable supplies to exempt supplies. Company B is required to repay input tax deemed incurred and deducted on the assets transferred.

The computation of the input tax repayable is computed below.

|Variable|Computation|
|-|-|
| Amount of input tax deemed deducted | GST rate x Value of assets<br>= 7% x $1m<br>= $70,000 |
| Change in ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies | 1 – ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies in the accounting period in which The Change occurs<br> = 1 – (100,000/2,000,000)<br>= 0.95 |
| Remaining number of accounting periods | Total number of accounting periods in 5 years – number of accounting periods from the Date of Transfer to the Date of Change (inclusive of both dates)<br>= (5 x 4) – 13<br>= 7 |
| Amount of input tax to be repaid | Input tax to be repaid <br>= Input tax deemed deducted<br>x Change inratio of taxable supplies to total supplies<br>x Remaining number of accounting periods<br>÷ Total number of accounting periods in 5 years<br>= $70,000 x 0.95 x 7 ÷ 20<br>= $23,275.00 |
| How the input tax should be repaid | Company B should deduct the amount of $23,275.00 from Box 7 (Input tax and refund claims) of the GST return for the period ended 30 Jun 2013. |
