1.1 This e-Tax Guide[^1] explains and provides examples of transactions that are
regarded as neither a supply of goods nor services and hence are not subject
to GST.

[^1]: This e-Tax guide is a consolidation of two previous e-Tax guides:
a) GST: “Transfer of business as a going concern” published on 29 Feb 2008.
b) “Goods and Services Tax Treatment of Transfer for a Consideration of “Qualifying Deductions”
allowed under the Income Tax Group Relief System” published on 16 July 2003.

1.2 You should read this guide if you are:


>(a) Transferring your business as a going concern; or

>(b) Transferring or assigning the title to the goods comprised in a hire
purchase agreement when you assign your right to receive payments
(as a financier) under the agreement to another financier; or

>(c) Transferring qualifying income tax deductions to another company
belonging to the same group of companies as you.
