# 6. Examples of Non-excluded Transactions

## Transfer of Shares

6.1 Where the shares of a limited company are transferred from one person to
another, there is no TOGC as the assets still belong to the limited company
(i.e. no change in the ownership of assets).

## Carrying on a Different Business

6.2 Company K, a property leasing business sells the retail space that it owns to
Company L. Company L intends to use the retail space to expand its fashion
retail business. As L is not using the property to carry on the same kind of
business as K, the sale does not qualify as a TOGC.

## Consecutive transfers of assets

6.3 Companies M, N, O are all taxable persons. M is in the business of property
leasing. M sells its properties to N which immediately sub-sells the properties
to O. Both sales are completed with the transfer of title to the properties from
M to O. The sale of the properties by M to N and then immediately from N to
O would not qualify as excluded transactions. As N does not use the properties
to carry on the same property leasing business as M, the transfer of properties
does not qualify as a TOGC.
