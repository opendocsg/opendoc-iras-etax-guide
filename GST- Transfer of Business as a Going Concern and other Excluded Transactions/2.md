# 2. At a Glance

2.1 All taxable supplies made by a GST-registered person are subject to GST.
However, certain transactions are specifically disregarded as supplies under
the Goods and Services Tax (Excluded Transactions) Order and are not
subject to GST. These transactions (“excluded transactions”) are:

>(a) The transfer of assets made under an agreement for the transfer of
business as a going concern (referred to in this guide as TOGC);

>(b) The transfer or assignment of title to goods comprised in a hire-
purchase agreement; or

>(c) The transfer of any qualifying deductions under section 37C of the
Income Tax Act.

2.2 In the case of a TOGC, this guide primarily sets out:

>(a) The conditions for the supply of assets transferred to be treated as an
excluded transaction (“TOGC conditions” elaborated under paragraph
4);

>(b) The GST treatment for the recovery of input tax in relation to a TOGC
(paragraph 7);

>(c) The GST treatment for the repayment of input tax deemed deducted
when the transferee (new owner) changes or intends to change the
usage of the transferred assets (paragraph 9); and


>(d) The GST obligations of the transferor (previous owner) and the
transferee (paragraph 10).

2.3 A taxable person who transfers or disposes the assets of his business,
whether or not for a consideration[^2] , will have to account for GST on such
transfer or disposal unless he satisfies all the TOGC conditions.

[^2]: If input tax has been allowed on the assets, the taxable person will have to account for output tax even if the assets are transferred without consideration.
