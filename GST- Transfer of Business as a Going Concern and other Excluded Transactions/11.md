# 11. Other Excluded Transactions: Transfer of Title to Goods in Hire-purchase Agreement

11.1 In a hire purchase agreement, a financier makes two supplies:

> (a) A taxable supply of goods to the customer; and

> (b) An exempt supply of services from the provision of instalment credit
facility

11.2 After concluding the hire-purchase transaction with his customer, the financier may transfer his rights under the hire-purchase agreement to another financier to continue providing financing to the customer. The title of the goods under the hire-purchase will then be transferred to the second financier.

11.3 As the supply of goods had already been made by the first financier to the hirer at the onset, the subsequent transfer of the goods by the first financier to the second financier is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services. Hence, GST is not chargeable on the transfer.
