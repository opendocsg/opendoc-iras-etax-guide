# 7. Claiming Input Tax on TOGC Expenses

7.1 The transferor or the transferee can claim input tax for the GST that he incurs
on expenses relating to the TOGC (“TOGC expenses”), provided that the
expenses are:

> (a) attributable to his taxable supplies or out-of-scope supplies which
would be taxable if made in Singapore;

> (b) supported by valid tax invoices; and

> (c) are not disallowed under regulations 26 and 27 of the GST (General)
Regulations[^10]

7.2 Some examples of TOGC expenses are professional fees paid by the
transferee to conduct due diligence on the transferred business, and the legal
fees paid by the transferor to draft the transfer agreement.

## Transferee

7.3 If the transferee acquires assets by way of an excluded transaction and the
assets are to be used exclusively to make taxable supplies, the GST incurred
on the TOGC expenses can be recovered in full. Conversely, if the assets of
the acquired business are to be used exclusively to make exempt supplies,
none of the input tax on the expenses attributable to the TOGC can be
recovered. If the assets are to be used in making both taxable and exempt
supplies, the input tax incurred on the TOGC expenses must be apportioned
in accordance with the partial exemption method applicable to the
transferee[^11].

[^10]: They are namely (a) club subscription fee, (b) medical and accident insurance premium, (c) medical expenses; (d) family benefits, (e) transactions involving betting sweepstakes, lotteries, fruit machines or games of chances; and (f) expenses relating to motor cars.

[^11]: Please refer to the e-Tax guide on “GST: Partially Exempt Traders and Input Tax Recovery”, which
is available from [http://www.iras.gov.sg](http://www.iras.gov.sg) > Quick Links > e-Tax Guides > GST, for more information.

## Transferor

7.4 If the transferor sells his assets and the transaction qualifies as an excluded
transaction, the GST incurred on the TOGC expenses may be treated as the
general overheads of the transferor. Accordingly, the input tax on such
expenses is claimable as input tax of the transferor, subject to the input tax
attribution rules applicable to his business.
