# 6. General Conditions Governing the Carry-Back Relief

6 .1 Your claim for carry-back relief is subject to the following general
conditions:

**(a) Same business test**

6.2 To qualify for carry-back relief, you must satisfy the same business test.
This means that you will not be able to carry back the unabsorbed CA
granted for the first basis period that you commenced a trade, business
or profession. However, you can carry back the trade loss incurred for
that period as the same business test does not apply to trade losses.

To illustrate:

During the basis period for YA 2018 that you commenced a business, you incurred a trade loss of $50,000 and had unabsorbed CA of $20,000. You could carry back the trade loss of $50,000 (but not the unabsorbed CA of $20,000) to be deducted against your assessable income for YA 2017.

**(b) Shareholding test**

6.3 If you are a company, in addition to the same business test, you have to satisfy the shareholding test in order to carry back your QD.

To illustrate:

For YA 2018, your accounting period is 1 Jan 20 17 to 31 Dec 2017. You can carry back your QD for YA 20 18 to YA 2017 if your shareholders as at the following dates are substantially the same:

  </tr>

6.4 The Comptroller of Income Tax (“CIT”) may waive the shareholding test if it is satisfied that the substantial change in the shareholders is not for the purpose of deriving any tax benefit or obtaining any tax advantage.

If the CIT grants the waiver, you can only deduct the QD against the income from the same trade or business for which the CA was granted or to which the trade loss relates.

**(c) Amount of Qualifying deductions to be carried back**

6.5 The amount of QD that you can carry back is restricted to the lowest of:
<br/>(i) your actual amount of the QD;
<br/>(ii) your assessable income of the immediate preceding YA; and
<br/>(iii) $100,000.

6.6 The excess that is not carried back can be carried forward for deduction against your future taxable income if you satisfy the same business test (and shareholding test if you are a company).

To illustrate:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}

</style>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-qtf5">Your assessable income for YA 2017</th>
    <th class="tg-qtf5">$60,000</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-qtf5">Your QD for YA 2018</td>
    <td class="tg-qtf5">$72,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-qtf5">Amount of QD you can carry back to YA 2017</td>
    <td class="tg-qtf5">$60,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-qtf5">Excess that you can carry forward for deduction against future taxable income</td>
    <td class="tg-qtf5">$12,000</td>
  </tr>

Annex A shows how to determine the amount of QD to be carried back.

6.7 If your functional currency is not S$, the exchange rate to use for the
purpose of computing the cap of $100,000 is based on the exchange
rate of the year in which the loss arose.

To illustrate:

Your functional currency is the US$.
The exchange rate is 1.3833 for YA 2017 and 1.3749 for YA 2018.
You incurred a trade loss of US$150,000 for the YA 2018.

The amount of trade loss that you can carry back for deduction against
your assessable income for YA 2017 is computed as follows:

[Insert table]

**(d) Order of Deduction**

6.8 The QD carried back will be deducted from your assessable income of
the immediate preceding YA in the following order:

(a) current year unabsorbed CA, if any; and then
<br>
(b) current year trade loss, if any.

6.9 If you have other income in addition to trade income, the unabsorbed CA
and trade losses will be deducted against the other sources of income in
the order as follows:

1st : Income from same trade
<br>
2nd : Income from other trade (proportionately if there is more than one other trade, business, profession or vocation)
<br>
3rd : Income from all other sources (proportionately if there is more
than one other sources)


6.10 Where your QD exceed $100,000, and they arose from more than one
trade, business, profession or vocation, the amount you can carry back
for each of the trade, business, profession or vocation is also determined
on a proportionate basis.

Annex B provides examples on the order of deducting the QD carried back where there is more than:

(i) one trade source; and
<br/>(ii) one source of other income.
