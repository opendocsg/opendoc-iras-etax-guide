## 1. Aim

1.1 This e-Tax Guide provides details on the carry-back relief system.

1.2 The e-Tax Guide is relevant to you if you have unabsorbed capital
allowances[^1] (“CA”) or unabsorbed trade losses from your trade,
business, profession or vocation for the current year.

[^1] In this e-Tax guide, the term “capital allowances” refer to allowances given under sections 16, 17, 18B, 18C, 19, 19A, 19B, 19C, 19D or 20 of the ITA.

## 2. At a glance

2.1 The carry-back relief under section 37E of the Income Tax Act (“ITA”) is
available to all persons carrying on a business, including sole-
proprietorships and partnerships. The relief will be given only if a claim
is made for it.

2.2 Under the system, a person may carry back its current year qualifying
deductions (“QD”) and deduct them against its assessable income of the immediate preceding YA.

2.3 The maximum amount of QD that can be carried back is capped at
$100,000.

2.4 The QD will be deducted in the following order:
(i) current year’s unabsorbed CA, if any,
(ii) current year’s trade losses, if any.

2.5 The carry-back of unabsorbed CA is subject to the “same business” test.
A company will have to satisfy the shareholding test as well.

2.6 A company can elect to carry back its QD after transferring its loss items
under the group relief system[^2], if applicable.

2.7 An individual can elect to carry back his QD after transferring the QD to
his spouse[^3] for the same YA, if applicable.

[^2] Please refer to IRAS e-Tax Guide on ‘Group Relief System’ issued on 6 Sep 2011.
<br/>[^3] The spousal transfer scheme is only applicable up to YA 2015. For more information on the transitional arrangement, please refer to the e-Tax Guide on ‘Change to Assess the Income of a Husband and Wife as Separate Individuals’ issued on 26 May 2014.


## 3 Glossary

3.1 Assessable income

Assessable income of a company refers to its income from all sources after deducting CA, trade losses, approved donations (including those transferred from related companies under the group relief system) and other relevant deductions like incremental research and development expenses or investment allowances.

Assessable income of an individual refers to the individual’s income from all sources after deducting CA, losses, and approved donations (including those transferred from spouse).

3.2 Immediate Preceding YA

The immediate preceding YA refers to the YA immediately before the YA in which the person has trade losses or capital allowances available for carry back. For example, if the person incurred trade losses in year 2017 or is given capital allowances for YA 2018, the immediate preceding YA would be YA 201 7.

3.3 Loss items

For group relief purposes, loss items refer to the unabsorbed CA, trade losses and donations for the current year that can be transferred by a company (“transferor company”) to another company of the group (“claimant company”).

3.4 Person

Under section 2 of the ITA, a person includes a company, body of persons and a Hindu Joint Family.

3.5 Qualifying deductions (QD)

For carry-back relief purposes, QD are the unabsorbed CA and unabsorbed trade losses for the current year.

3.6 Relevant deductions

A limited partner’s share of CA and trade losses from a limited liability partnership (“LLP”) or limited partnership (“LP”) allowed against the partner’s income from other sources.

3.7 Same business test

This test determines if a person continues to carry on the same trade,
business, profession or vocation for which capital allowances are
granted when carrying forward or back the unabsorbed capital
allowances. The test is satisfied if the same trade, business, profession
or vocation is continued.

3.8 Shareholding test

This test computes the percentage of the shareholdings of a company (or its ultimate parent company) that is held by the same persons as at the relevant dates. If the percentage is 50% or more, there is no substantial change in the shareholders and the company is said to have satisfied the shareholding test.

Relevant dates for unabsorbed CA:
<br/> First day of the YA in which the capital allowances were granted and the
last day of the immediate preceding YA in which the capital allowances
are to be deducted.

Relevant dates for unabsorbed trade losses:
<br/>First day of the year in which the trade losses were incurred and last day
of the immediate preceding YA in which the trade losses are to be
deducted.

3.9 Unabsorbed capital allowances (CA)

The capital allowances claimed by a person (under section 16, 17, 18B,
18C, 19, 19A, 19B, 19C, 19D or 20 of the ITA) for a YA that exceed the
person’s aggregate taxable income for that YA.

3.10 Unabsorbed trade losses

The trade losses incurred by a person for a YA that exceed the person’s
income from all sources for that YA.

3.11 Unabsorbed donations

The approved donations made by a person in a YA that exceeds its
statutory income for that YA. Approved donations are donations
qualifying for tax deduction and made to recipients under sections 37(3)
(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of the ITA.

## 4. Background

4.1 Before YA 2006, a person may carry forward its unabsorbed CA and
trade losses to future YAs if it satisfies certain conditions under the ITA.


4.2 To help small businesses cope with cash-flow problems, especially in a
cyclical downturn, a one year carry-back of QD was introduced from the
YA 2006.

## 5. Carry-back relief system

5.1 Subject to conditions, the carry-back relief is available to you as a person
who carries on a trade, business, profession or vocation. You may be :

(a) a company;
<br/>(b) an individual sole-proprietor or partner of a partnership, including an LLP and a LP;
<br/>(c) a body of persons, such as clubs and associations; and
<br/>(d) a trustee of trusts or executor of estates.

5.2 You may carry back the QD to the immediate preceding YA to be deducted from your assessable income of the immediate preceding YA in the order set out in paragraphs 6. 8 and 6. 9.

## 6. General Conditions Governing the Carry-Back Relief

6 .1 Your claim for carry-back relief is subject to the following general
conditions:

**(a) Same business test**

6.2 To qualify for carry-back relief, you must satisfy the same business test.
This means that you will not be able to carry back the unabsorbed CA
granted for the first basis period that you commenced a trade, business
or profession. However, you can carry back the trade loss incurred for
that period as the same business test does not apply to trade losses.

To illustrate:

During the basis period for YA 2018 that you commenced a business, you incurred a trade loss of $50,000 and had unabsorbed CA of $20,000. You could carry back the trade loss of $50,000 (but not the unabsorbed CA of $20,000) to be deducted against your assessable income for YA 2017.

**(b) Shareholding test**

6.3 If you are a company, in addition to the same business test, you have to satisfy the shareholding test in order to carry back your QD.

To illustrate:

For YA 2018, your accounting period is 1 Jan 20 17 to 31 Dec 2017. You can carry back your QD for YA 20 18 to YA 2017 if your shareholders as at the following dates are substantially the same:

6.4 The Comptroller of Income Tax (“CIT”) may waive the shareholding test if it is satisfied that the substantial change in the shareholders is not for the purpose of deriving any tax benefit or obtaining any tax advantage.

If the CIT grants the waiver, you can only deduct the QD against the income from the same trade or business for which the CA was granted or to which the trade loss relates.

**(c) Amount of Qualifying deductions to be carried back**

6.5 The amount of QD that you can carry back is restricted to the lowest of:
<br/>(i) your actual amount of the QD;
<br/>(ii) your assessable income of the immediate preceding YA; and
<br/>(iii) $100,000.

6.6 The excess that is not carried back can be carried forward for deduction against your future taxable income if you satisfy the same business test (and shareholding test if you are a company).

Annex A shows how to determine the amount of QD to be carried back.

6.7 If your functional currency is not S$, the exchange rate to use for the
purpose of computing the cap of $100,000 is based on the exchange
rate of the year in which the loss arose.

To illustrate:

Your functional currency is the US$.
The exchange rate is 1.3833 for YA 2017 and 1.3749 for YA 2018.
You incurred a trade loss of US$150,000 for the YA 2018.

The amount of trade loss that you can carry back for deduction against
your assessable income for YA 2017 is computed as follows:

[Insert table]

**(d) Order of Deduction**

6.8 The QD carried back will be deducted from your assessable income of
the immediate preceding YA in the following order:
<br/>(a) current year unabsorbed CA, if any; and then
<br/>(b) current year trade loss, if any.

6.9 If you have other income in addition to trade income, the unabsorbed CA
and trade losses will be deducted against the other sources of income in
the order as follows:

<br/>1 st : Income from same trade
<br/>2 nd : Income from other trade (proportionately if there is more than one other trade, business, profession or vocation)
<br/>3rd : Income from all other sources (proportionately if there is more
than one other sources)


6.10 Where your QD exceed $100,000, and they arose from more than one
trade, business, profession or vocation, the amount you can carry back
for each of the trade, business, profession or vocation is also determined
on a proportionate basis.

Annex B provides examples on the order of deducting the QD carried back where there is more than:

(i) one trade source; and
<br/>(ii) one source of other income.

## 7 Carry-back relief under specific scenarios

**(a) Where income is taxed at concessionary rate**

7.1 If you are a company with income chargeable to tax at the normal corporate tax rate, but your QD relate to income chargeable to tax at
concessionary tax rate, the adjustment provided under section 37B of the ITA, (“adjustment factor”) has be applied for deduction across
income chargeable under different tax rates.

7.2 In addition, the amount of QD (up to $100,000) is determined based on the following formula:

<br/>A + B
<br/>where 
<br/>A = any amount deducted against assessable income subject to tax at the normal corporate tax rate (currently 17%);
<br/>B = any amount deducted against assessable income subject to tax at any concessionary rate of tax divided by the adjustment factor for that concessionary rate of tax;
<br/>and the adjustment factor = Normal corporate tax divided by the Concessionary tax rate

7.3 Annex C is an example on the carry-back of QD for a company deriving income that is subject to tax at a concessionary rate.

Annexes D1 and D2 give more examples on the carry-back of QD where there is income from more than one other trade, or more than one other
source of income.

**(b) Where group relief is claimed**

7.4 If you are a company which has elected for group relief, the amount of QD you can carry back is the net amount after deducting the loss items transferred out to the eligible claimant company or companies. Annex E illustrates how this is being done.

7.5 Annex F shows the order of deduction for companies at a glance.

**(c) Where transfer to spouse is made**

7.6 The spousal transfer scheme has been phased out with effect from YA 2016. Any QD arising from YA 2016 (basis year 2015) onwards would
no longer enjoy spousal transfer. However, under section 37E, you may continue to carry-back the QD to deduct against your assessable income
of the immediate preceding YA. Annex G provides an illustration on how carry-back relief is effected for an individual and his spouse where
transfer under section 37D is made prior to YA 2016.

**(d) Where the relief reduces personal reliefs**

7.7 If you are an individual, you are entitled to the following personal reliefs
based on your earned income for that YA:

(a) earned income relief;
<br/>(b) working mother child relief (for a married woman); and
<br/>(c) deduction for CPF contributions by a self-employed.

7.8 As the QD carried back would reduce your earned income of the immediate preceding YA, your personal reliefs for the immediate
preceding YA would have to be revised accordingly based on your revised earned income for that YA.

**(e) Where the relief is for limited partners of an LLP or a LP**

7.9 If you are a limited partner of an LLP or a LP, your relevant deductions, together with all of your relevant deductions allowed in all past YAs, must not exceed your contributed capital as at the end of the basis period relating to that YA. This restriction is known as the “relevant deduction restriction[^4]”. Any excess of the relevant deductions over your contributed capital may then (subject to conditions) be carried forward to be deducted against your future share of income from the same LLP or LP.

7.10 The relevant deduction restriction also applies for the purpose of carry-back relief. Your capital contribution as at the end of the basis period relating to the YA that the QD arise will be used for the relevant deduction restriction. This is because your QD to be carried back relate to that YA and not the immediate preceding YA.

7.11 Annex H shows how the carry back deduction and restriction of the qualifying deductions are applied to partners of an LLP.

[^4] For an explanation of what is “contributed capital” and more details of the relevant deduction
restriction”, please refer to IRAS e-Tax Guide on “Income Tax Treatment of Limited Liability
Partnerships (Second Edition)” issued on 1 Mar 2014.


## 8 Specific exclusions for carry-back relief

8.1 You will not be able to carry back your QD if the QD arise from certain
trade or activity carried on. They are:

(a) Qualifying deductions of a trade where the income is wholly exempt from tax

If you carry on such a trade (e.g. pioneer trade), you are not allowed to carry back the QD relating to that trade for deduction against other exempt or non-exempt income.

(b) Qualifying deductions of specific activity or trade

If you carry on specific types of activity or trade where there are rules restricting the deduction of the QD only against such trade
or activity, or restricting the carry forward of the QD, you are to apply the same restriction in the carry back of the QD. The QD
from such trade or activities are not allowed to be deducted against your other sources of income or your spouse’s income.

These activities or trades include:
(i) finance leasing where the income is taxable under section 10D of the ITA; and
(ii) the business of hiring out motor cars where the income is taxable under section 10H of the ITA.
(c) Qualifying deductions of a Section 10E company

If you carry on a business of the making of investments, you are not allowed to carry forward your QD arising from that business. As the QD are disregarded, the carry- back relief does not apply.

(d) Loss of eligible investors in approved start-up companies under the Enterprise Investment Incentive Scheme (EII)[^5]

Currently, an eligible investor holding qualifying shares in approved start-up under the Enterprise Investment Incentive
scheme (EII) may incur a capital loss upon:
(i) the sale of its qualifying shares; or
(ii) the liquidation of the approved start-up companies.

As the loss is capital in nature, it does not qualify for carry- back
relief.
