# 10. Refund of excess tax

10.1 Where there is tax to be refunded from the carry-back of the QD, the CIT will refund the amount within 3 months from the date you (or together with your spouse) make the election. If there is any tax owing for the other tax types (e.g. property tax), the amount of tax to be refunded to you is the net amount after deducting your other outstanding tax liabilities.
