9.5 If you are a partner of a partnership/LLP/LP and have elected to carry back your share of the QD from the partnership/LLP/LP, you need not submit the financial accounts of the trade, business, profession or vocation carried on through the partnership/LLP/LP. However, you must, at the time of making the election, ensure that the precedent partner of the partnership/LLP/LP has already submitted to the CIT the following documents:

[^6] The prescribed election form is available at [http://www.iras.gov.sg.](http://www.iras.gov.sg.)

<br/>(a) the certified statement of financial accounts; and
<br/>(b) the tax computation showing your share of CA/loss from the
partnership/LLP/LP.

9.6 The precedent partner may submit a set of provisional accounts and tax computation if the certified statement of financial accounts and tax computation are not finalised when the partner makes the election.

9.7 The CIT may treat the election as invalid if the precedent partner does not comply with the requirements.

**Election made after filing the income tax return**

9.8 As an individual you may elect for the carry-back relief after filing your income tax return for the relevant current YA (but no later than 30 days from the date of service of the notice of assessment for the current YA on you). You only need to submit the completed and signed prescribed election form.

**Bodies of persons/trustees/executors making the election**

9.9 Bodies of persons/trustees/executors may elect for the carry-back relief by submitting the completed and signed prescribed election form, together with a provisional/finalised set of tax computation and financial accounts for the current YA and the revised tax computation for the immediate preceding YA (no later than the time of filing the income tax return for the current YA).
