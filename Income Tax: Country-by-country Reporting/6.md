# 6. Submission of CbC Reports

6.1 IRAS is currently developing e-services for receiving and sending CbC Reports with a sufficient level of encryption.

6.2 As the first CbC Reports will be required for data for FY 2017, and a Reporting Entity will have 12 months from the end of a financial year to submit the CbC Report for that financial year, the earliest CbC Report required to be submitted to IRAS would be due by 31 December 2018 (for a financial year ending on 31 December 2017 ).

6.3 Based on available information, IRAS will identify taxpayers affected by CbCR and provide further information on the submission of CbC Reports in the first half of 2018^5. Any taxpayer who believes that it will be required to file a CbC Report may also contact IRAS to find out more about CbCR.

6.4 In the event that the taxpayers did not submit the CbC report, they may be penalized under Section 105M of the ITA.

(^5) IRAS will issue further guidance on the additional data fields (e.g. identification number of reporting entity and constituent entities) that will be required for administrative purposes in relation to the CbC Report.
