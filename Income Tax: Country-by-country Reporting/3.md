# 3. Introduction to CbCR

3.1 In the Final Report on BEPS Action 13 “Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting” published by the OECD in October 2015, a new form of reporting namely CbCR would form part of the transfer pricing documentation to be maintained by MNEs.

3.2 Singapore is implementing CbCR for Singapore MNE groups from FY 2017 onwards.

3.3 Broadly, CbCR is required for an MNE group in relation to a financial year (the first such year being FY 2017), where:
<br/>(a) The MNE group is a Singapore MNE group;
<br/>(b) The consolidated group revenue in the preceding financial year is at least S$1,125 million; and
<br/>(c) The MNE group has subsidiaries or operations in at least one foreign
jurisdiction.

3.4 If a Singapore MNE group is required to file a CbC Report for a financial year, its ultimate parent entity, which is its Reporting Entity for the purpose of CbCR, will be required to submit a CbC Report to the Comptroller within 12 months from the end of that financial year.

3.5 Submission of CbC Reports to the Comptroller must be done electronically in accordance with the format specified by the Comptroller in this Guide.

3.6 Based on the identification of relevant jurisdictions in a CbC Report submitted by a Reporting Entity, the Comptroller will provide the CbC Report to the tax authorities of those jurisdictions if there is an agreement with the relevant tax authority for the automatic exchange of CbCR information.

3.7 Any information that is obtained by a tax authority from CbC Reports obtained through automatic exchange of information (“AEOI”) is strictly confidential.
