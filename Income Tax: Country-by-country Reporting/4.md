# 4. Transfer Pricing Documentation

4.1 IRASâ€™ Transfer Pricing Guidelines require taxpayers to organise their transfer pricing documentation at Group level and Entity level.

4.2 CbC Reports are supplementary to such transfer pricing documentation.

4.3 A CbC Report requires aggregate tax jurisdiction-wide information relating to the global allocation of the income, the taxes paid, and certain indicators of the location of economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which the reporting MNE group operates. The report also requires a listing of all the entities (including permanent establishments) for which financial information is reported, including the tax jurisdiction of incorporation, where different from the tax jurisdiction of residence, as well as the nature of the main business activities carried out.

4.4 A CbC Report will be helpful for high-level transfer pricing risk assessment purposes. It may also be used by tax authorities in evaluating other BEPS related risks and where appropriate for economic and statistical analysis. The information in the CbC Report should not be used as a substitute for a detailed transfer pricing analysis of individual transactions and pricesbased on a full functional analysis and a full comparability analysis. The information in the CbC Report on its own does not constitute conclusive evidence that transfer prices are or are not appropriate. It should not be used by tax administrations to propose transfer pricing adjustments.
