```
a. rental income or income from the management or holding of
immovable property but not including gains from the disposal of

iii. any other person approved by the Comptroller.
```
```
The rental support payment must be made on an open market value
basis. Any amount of rental support payment which is in excess of the
shortfall in market rental income will not be granted tax transparency
and will be taxed in the hands of the trustee; and
```
```
e. distribution from an approved sub-trust^10 of the S-REIT in cash out of

income derived by the trustee from placing cash surpluses in bank deposits or debt securities.
(^10) Tax transparency treatment will only be accorded to the distributions of an S-REIT made out of the
distribution it receives from an approved sub-trust, if the sub-trust enjoys approved sub-trust status
during the period the sub-trust derived its income (out of which the distribution is made) and at the
point of distribution to the S-REIT.

trust on or after 29 December 2016 by:

```

interest in the owner of the property;
```
```
b) a person who wholly owns (directly or indirectly) the seller;
or
```
```
c) any other person approved by the Comptroller.
```
The rental support payment must be made on an open market value

the shortfall in market rental income will not be granted tax
transparency and will be taxed in the hands of the trustee of the sub-
trust.
