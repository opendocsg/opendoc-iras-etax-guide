1.1 This e-Tax guide explains the income tax treatment of a real estate
investment trust exchange-traded fund (“REIT ETF”) which has been
accorded the tax transparency treatment.

1.2 The guide will be relevant to you if you are a trustee, manager, unit holder or
potential investor of a REIT ETF.

1.3 This guide covers the tax treatment of REIT ETFs which receive distributions
from REITs listed on the Singapore Exchange (“S-REITs”), including REIT
ETFs that have been accorded tax concession under the following schemes:

```
a. Designated Unit Trust
b. Approved Unit Trust
c. Income of prescribed persons arising from funds managed by fund
manager in Singapore
d. Income arising from funds managed by fund manager in Singapore^4.
```
1.4 However, this guide does not cover the tax treatment of any other income
(for example, distributions from foreign REITs) derived by REIT ETFs. The
Income Tax Act, Revised Edition 2014 (Cap. 134) (“ITA”) has specific
provisions that deal with the tax treatment of other income derived by the
above trusts. Thus, the tax treatment of such income will continue to be
governed by the respective provisions in the ITA.
