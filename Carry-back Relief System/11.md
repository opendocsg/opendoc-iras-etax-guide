# 11. Time limit for CIT to raise additional assessments

11.1 If the CIT discovers that the amount of QD carried back and deducted against your assessable income of any immediate preceding YA was excessive, the CIT would make an assessment on the amount which should be charged to tax within 5 years after the end of that YA.


11.2 To illustrate:

**Example 1**

You have carried back your trade loss of $ 8 0,000 for YA 20 18 to be deducted against your assessable income for YA 2017. The trade loss is subsequently reduced to $57,000. CIT may:
<br/>(a) revise the assessment for YA 20 18 (to reduce the amount of the loss); and
<br/>(b) raise an additional assessment for YA 2017 (in respect of $23, over allowed) by 31 Dec 2022.
