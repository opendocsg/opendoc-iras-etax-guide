2.1 The carry-back relief under section 37E of the Income Tax Act (“ITA”) is
available to all persons carrying on a business, including sole-
proprietorships and partnerships. The relief will be given only if a claim
is made for it.

2.2 Under the system, a person may carry back its current year qualifying
deductions (“QD”) and deduct them against its assessable income of the immediate preceding YA.

2.3 The maximum amount of QD that can be carried back is capped at
$100,000.

2.4 The QD will be deducted in the following order:
(i) current year’s unabsorbed CA, if any,
(ii) current year’s trade losses, if any.

2.5 The carry-back of unabsorbed CA is subject to the “same business” test.
A company will have to satisfy the shareholding test as well.

under the group relief system[^2], if applicable.

2.7 An individual can elect to carry back his QD after transferring the QD to
his spouse[^3] for the same YA, if applicable.
