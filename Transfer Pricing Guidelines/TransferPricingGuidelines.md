1 Aim

1.1 This e-Tax guide analyses the economic value of taxpayers’ commodity
marketing and trading activities in Singapore and helps taxpayers to
comply with the arm’s length principle and transfer pricing
documentation requirement when such activities are carried out with
their related parties.

1.2 This e-Tax guide is relevant to you if you are a business entity
incorporated or registered in Singapore and involved in the business of
marketing and/or trading in commodities. You will need to read and apply
the principles and guidance set out in the IRAS Transfer Pricing
Guidelines together with the specific guidance in this e-Tax Guide.

1.3 IRAS generally takes guidance from the OECD Transfer Pricing
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations.

2 At a glance

2.1 A number of multinational enterprise groups (“MNE groups”) set up
operations in Singapore to conduct commodity marketing and trading
activities. Proximity to key markets and depth of the trading market in
Singapore are often cited as the key reasons to base such operations in
Singapore.

2.2 Commodity marketing and trading activities involve not just buying and
selling commodities, but a wide spectrum of activities, such as sourcing,
collecting real time market intelligence, managing logistics, optimising
physical movement and delivery of cargoes, determining commodity
placement strategy, sales and marketing, blending, storage, building and
maintaining customer relationships, managing risks and cash flows,
financial management, etc.

2.3 The precise nature of the activities and their contribution to value can
vary widely. Where such activities are conducted between related
parties, a thorough examination of the actual functions performed,
assets used and risks assumed in each specific related party commodity
transaction is important in determining the arm’s length transfer price.


3 Glossary

3.1 Commodities

```
Commodities include natural resources from the extractive industry
(usually refer to as hard commodities, such as oil, gas, coal, metals and
minerals), agricultural commodities (usually refer to as soft commodities,
such as cotton, corn, grains, palm, coffee and sugar), and commodities
that are transformed (usually refer to as secondary commodities, such
as gasoline and fuel from refining crude oil, liquefied natural gas from
cooling natural gas down to liquid form, and aluminium from smelting
alumina).
```
3.2 Commodity marketing/trading entities

```
Entities (including branches) set up in Singapore to conduct commodity
marketing activities or commodity trading activities or both.
```
3.3 Multinational enterprise group **(“MNE group”)**

```
A group of related entities or parties with business establishments in two
or more countries.
```
3.4 Supplier

```
An entity which owns or produces commodities. It can also be another
commodity trading entity.
```

4 Background

4.1 Singapore’s history as a trading nation can be traced back to the 14th
century. Singapore is a leading hub for international commodity trade as
she is at the crossroads of major shipping and communication routes,
has one of the world’s major oil refining and distribution centres and is in
close proximity to producers, suppliers, global trading entities and fast-
growing markets. For these reasons, MNE groups (both international
and local) choose to base their commodity marketing and trading
activities in Singapore.

4.2 Entities (including branches) may be set up in Singapore to conduct
commodity marketing activities or commodity trading activities or both
(“commodity marketing/trading activities”). These entities are referred to
as commodity marketing/trading entities in this e-Tax guide. They deal
in commodities with their related parties, third parties or both. For
example, a commodity marketing/trading entity may buy commodities
from related parties and sell them to third or related parties or both; or
buy commodities from third parties and sell them to third or related
parties or both. Third parties and related parties from whom commodity
marketing/trading entities source their commodities, could own or
produce commodities or be other commodity trading entities (collectively
refer to as “suppliers” in this e-Tax guide).

4.3 Commodities include natural resources from the extractive industry
(usually refer to as hard commodities, such as oil, gas, coal, metals and
minerals), agricultural commodities (usually refer to as soft commodities,
such as cotton, corn, grains, palm, coffee and sugar), and commodities
that are transformed (usually refer to as secondary commodities, such
as gasoline and fuel from refining crude oil, liquefied natural gas from
cooling natural gas down to liquid form, and aluminium from smelting
alumina).

4.4 As commodities are rarely produced and consumed in the same place,
at the same time or in the same form, a complex value chain, covering
origination, sourcing, refining, processing, storage, shipping, etc., is
usually required to get the commodities to the customers. Linking these
value chain elements together is commodity marketing and trading which
ensure the right commodity turns up in the right place, at the right time
and at the most competitive cost.

4.5 Commodity marketing/trading entities undertake a wide spectrum of
commodity marketing/trading activities with different levels of intensity.
They may carry different levels of assets, such as inventory, working
capital and intangibles (example, customer relationships and deep
market knowledge). They may bear varying types and extent of risks.
Their level of functions, assets and risks would depend on the commodity
that they deal in and the specific market characteristics for that
commodity.


4.6 Commodity marketing/trading entities could be organised at varying
depths of sophistication. Their operations could be undertaken through
different business models. The structures and value chains of MNE
groups could also vary according to the commodities the groups deal in
and to what makes commercial sense for the groups. Furthermore, the
operating principles and techniques for marketing and trading could vary
across different commodities and markets.

4.7 Examples provided in this e-Tax guide are illustrative and do not capture
fully the myriad of arrangements that commodity marketing/trading
entities have. This e-Tax guide also does not seek to provide detailed
discussion on the operations of the commodity industry. Instead, it
recognises the diversity in the commodity marketing/trading activities
undertaken by commodity marketing/trading entities operating in
Singapore and the wide ranging values they could bring to their
businesses and to their MNE groups. The arm’s length transfer price
should, therefore, take into account such diversities.


5 Commercial objectives of commodity marketing/trading entities^1

Commercial objectives in conducting commodity marketing/trading
activities

5.1 A commodity marketing/trading entity may act at different levels of the
market across a range of customers, suppliers and commodities, or
transact with the same party at different times or under different
circumstances for various commercial objectives. The following are
some examples.

5.2 A commodity marketing/trading entity may provide service to a supplier,
such as gathering market intelligence through day-to-day contact with
customers and public media coverage for a certain commodity in the
country, without assuming any risk relating to the commodity. This
service, for example, enables the supplier to have an understanding of
the local market and to develop that market for its commodity.

5.3 A commodity marketing/trading entity may act as an agent on behalf of
a supplier in developing and servicing a market by providing detailed
market intelligence, building customer contacts, managing customer
relationships, having specific but limited authority to act on behalf of the
supplier in identifying and negotiating with customers, preparing and
reviewing supply contracts, co-ordinating and scheduling delivery,
dealing with day-to-day administrative matters necessary to service
customers, etc.^2 It may also perform a marketing role with decision-
making capacity similar to a distributor except that it has no obligation to
purchase and sell the commodity.^2 In such instance, its activities may
extend beyond those described above to freight and logistics, credit
management, demurrage and sale administration, formulation of
strategies, etc. The marketing role is particularly important for the highly
cyclical nature and capital intensive commodity sector where
commitment and certainty of sales is critical to ensure long term
production at or close to capacity. The aim of marketing operations is to
maximise profit margins on the entire life cycle of the production facility
notwithstanding the volatility of market cycles. The commodity
marketing/trading entity, whether as an agent or performing marketing
role, does not assume risks relating to the commodity, but may be
appointed to manage or control those risks. It may assume risks in whole
or in part (i.e. shared risks) arising from its functions, such as freight risk.

(^1) This section on the commodity industry in Singapore is developed with the support of the
Enterprise Singapore (“ESG”).
(^2) Depending on the extent of the entity’s involvement in identifying and negotiating sales
opportunities for the supplier, its activities may create a permanent establishment in
Singapore for the cross border supplier under Section 2 of the Singapore Income Tax Act
or the relevant avoidance of double taxation agreement. Also see section 14 of IRAS
Transfer Pricing Guidelines on attribution of profit to permanent establishment.


5.4 A commodity marketing/trading entity may operate as a full risk-taking
entrepreneur – purchasing commodity from multiple sources (i.e. from
the MNE group and/or third parties) and be fully responsible for trading
and maintaining market for the commodity on its own account. The
commercial objectives for operating as a full risk-taking entrepreneur
include balancing the market, aligning diverse suppliers and customers,
taking on commitment to allow project investments, acting as central
management for shipping, storage and risk management through
physical and derivative transactions. Such commodity marketing/trading
entity can operate through different business models as illustrated
below.

```
Example 1
```
```
The commodity marketing/trading entity could be set up within the MNE
group’s supply chain that stretches from exploration and production to
supply to customers. The commodity marketing/trading entity could
optimise returns on the commodity and reduce earnings volatility through
various strategies, such as:
```
```
 Trading on commodity and arbitraging its position through
aggregated regional or global trading book.
```
```
 Adopting a portfolio trading strategy (i.e. a portfolio of varied supply
sources with different contract pricing terms and contract lengths) for
flexibility in managing diverse customers’ needs and customer non-
performance, in meeting supply and demand imbalances through
diversion of cargoes and arbitrage, etc.
```
```
The commodity marketing/trading entity could offer producers in the
MNE group guaranteed offtake of the production so that producers
eliminate the risk in finding customers. It could also offer customers
flexible and competitive terms due to its portfolio mix.
```
Example 2

```
The commodity marketing/trading entity could be set up as a commodity
trading entity to purchase, transport, store and deliver commodities as
principal and sell them to customers. It bridges gaps between producers
and customers. For example, to bridge quality gap, the commodity
marketing/trading entity blends commodities from multiple sources to
match customer requirements. It also seeks out arbitrage opportunities
to derive trading profits. For example, by sourcing and selling
commodities in every region of the world, the commodity
marketing/trading entity could optimise the geographical location of its
supply and demand to reduce logistical costs. The commodity
marketing/trading entity conducts its trading and arbitrage activities with
other commodity trading entities within the MNE group on an aggregated
regional or global trading book basis. Its trading volumes are usually from
```

```
third party producers but the MNE group may have its own production
capability to better manage risks and to be more effective in trading.
```
```
Example 3
```
```
A MNE group produces and trades in multiple commodities from multiple
mines in multiple countries around the world. By centralising commodity
marketing/trading activities within a commodity marketing/trading entity,
the MNE group is able to market its production more effectively through
better coordination of supply and customers’ demand schedules and
more macro oversight and management of risks.
```
5.5 Commodity marketing/trading activities and their value to the MNE
groups are further elaborated in section 6 of this e-Tax guide.

Commercial considerations in setting up commodity marketing/trading
entities in Singapore

5.6 Commodity marketing/trading entities usually choose to locate their
operations in places with necessary attributes that facilitate commodity
marketing/trading activities. Singapore is a preferred location because of
the depth of her trading market and her close proximity to key markets
that drive supply and demand for key commodities. Some of the key
attributes that Singapore possesses are described in the following
paragraphs.

```
Participant network
```
5.7 Singapore has an extensive network of buyers and sellers and a mix of
participants operating under various models and across different
commodities. Some examples are marketing for producers, global
trading and procurement for customers. Singapore offers a neutral
playing field where no single producer or consumer can dominate the
market. These factors facilitate price discovery and demand/supply
matching and balancing, and allow commodities marketing/trading
entities to effectively structure deals, create new commodity trading
opportunities and deepen market liquidity.

```
Human capital
```
5.8 Singapore offers a multi-lingual talent pool that possesses the
knowledge and cultural awareness to facilitate marketing and trading
with the world’s largest growing markets such as China, India and
ASEAN. Singapore’s high living standards and world-leading
infrastructure also attract top decision-makers and leaders from major
MNE groups.


```
Financial and trading infrastructure
```
5.9 As a global financial centre, Singapore offers:

```
(a) A wide range of financial institutions for the commodity industry.
```
```
(b) An efficient foreign exchange clearing, risk management
infrastructure and easy access to commodity exchanges.
```
```
(c) A wide range of price discovery and hedging solutions, such as
SICOM rubber futures, SGX iron ore swaps, Platts FOB Straits
benchmark and LNG spot index (SGX LNG Index Group).^3
```
```
Legal and arbitration framework
```
5.10 Singapore offers political and economic stability and a strong legal and
arbitration framework. This helps commodity marketing/trading entities
to mitigate risk of holding assets out of Singapore and gives them the
confidence to invest in key infrastructures and capabilities here.

```
General business environment
```
5.11 With direct air routes to more than 400 global destinations, Singapore
acts as a gateway between East and West and provides a central
location for commodity marketing/trading entities to manage relationship
with their counterparts across Asia.

```
Physical flows and infrastructure
```
5.12 Singapore’s geographical advantage is also complemented by her
logistics capabilities, infrastructure and wide access to processing and
storage facilities. With Singapore being a key global shipping centre,
material synergies can be achieved when commodity marketing/trading
activities are co-located with freight service providers.

```
Summary of Singapore’s key attributes
```
5.13 Figure 1 below summarises the key attributes which are often the
commercial considerations for commodity marketing/trading entities
choosing to locate their operations in Singapore.

(^3) SICOM and SGX stand for Singapore Commodity Exchange and Singapore Exchange,
respectively.

trading hub – Singapore’s role and proposition.


6 Transfer pricing for commodity marketing/trading activities

Introduction

6.1 A commodity marketing/trading entity must price its transactions with its
related parties that involve commodity marketing/trading activities
(“related party commodity transactions”) at arm’s length. 5

6.2 This section provides guidance on how to analyse related party
commodity transactions and the transfer pricing methods that may be
appropriate to determine the arm’s length transfer price. This section
does not cover other related party transactions, such as related party
loans. The guidance for other related party transactions is provided in
the IRAS Transfer Pricing Guidelines.

6.3 While this section discusses the functional analysis and selection of
transfer pricing methods from the perspective of the commodity
marketing/trading entity, this is not to say the contribution of the related
party to the transaction is not important. The guidance in this section
applies to the related party as it would apply to the commodity
marketing/trading entity depending on which is the tested party.

Comparability analysis

6.4 Depending on the arrangement between the commodity
marketing/trading entity and its related party, a related party commodity
transaction can take many forms, such as:

```
(a) Market research service relating to certain commodity,
```
```
(b) Marketing functions relating to certain commodity,
```
```
(c) Purchase or sale of certain commodity, or
```
```
(d) Trading certain commodity on an aggregated regional or global
trading book basis by commodity trading entities within the MNE
group.
```
6.5 Thus, it is important to accurately delineate the actual related party
commodity transaction. This requires understanding the commodity
industry in which the MNE group operates and establishing the
economically relevant characteristics of the transaction which broadly
cover:

```
(a) The contractual terms of the related party commodity transaction.
Where there are material differences between the contractual
```
(^5) The arm’s length requirement is provided in section 34D of the Income Tax Act.


```
terms and the actual conduct of the related parties, the actual
related party commodity transaction should be determined from the
actual conduct.
```
```
(b) The characteristics of commodity sold or purchased, services
received or provided, or intangible properties used or transferred
under the related party commodity transaction. See guidance
below relating to functional analysis.
```
```
(c) The functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the
parties to the related party commodity transaction. See guidance
below relating to functional analysis.
```
```
(d) The commercial and economic circumstances of the related parties
and of the market in which they operate. These circumstances can
have considerable impact on the pricing of the related party
commodity transaction. For instance, whether the market is at the
stage where supply exceeds demand or vice versa may affect the
value of a commodity marketing/trading entity’s functions.
```
Functional analysis

6.6 The functional profile of a commodity marketing/trading entity for a
related party commodity transaction is dependent on the nature of the
commodity marketing/trading activities it performs (taking into account
assets used and risks assumed) which in turn define its contribution to
value.

Functions performed by and the role of commodity marketing/trading entity

6.7 The intensity of functions performed by a commodity marketing/trading
entity varies according to the nature of the related party commodity
transaction.

6.8 Figure 2 gives some examples of commodity marketing/trading activities
that may be undertaken in a related party commodity transaction. Figure
3 describes some possible benefits and outcomes from commodity
marketing/trading activities.

Figure 3 : Some possible outcomes from commodity marketing/trading activities

```
Right product
(Commodity)
```
```
Provide access to a commodity or alternate forms/lot sizes to improve reliability or
quality
Example: Nickel ore is replaced by lower cost nickel pig iron
```
```
Right form
(Intermediates)
```
```
Determine more optimal transformations of the commodity to better match
customers’ needs or for more value-add
Example: Modify output mix from a refinery based on relative product demand
Blend products to meet the product specifications and customer’s
requirements
Right credit
(Financing)
```
```
Secure cheaper financing sources for production, logistics or consumption points
to reduce costs (capital expenditure or working capital)
Example: Commodity marketing/trading entity provides prepayments to secure
long-term commodity supplies
Right place
(Geography)
```
```
Determine better geographic matches (beyond just proximity) for origin-destination
to improve system efficiency and lower overall cost
Example: Ship Australian ore to China and American ore to Europe
```
```
Right way
(Logistics)
```
```
Deploy a better optimal structure for the overall logistics network to serve
suppliers/customers more effectively
Example: Better use of shipping routes to optimise empty haul backs and
therefore, avoid need for additional ships
Right time
(Time)
```
```
Use more optimal timing for physical delivery (or pick-up) of a commodity based
on market pricing or demand expectations
Example: Pre-buying LNG and stocking in tanks for high-demand winter seasons
```
```
Right
conditions
```
```
Match the above factors to forecast and changing market conditions so as to
manage those factors more effectively in a volatile market environment
Example: Commodity marketing/trading entities provide real-time monitoring,
possess commercial skills and expertise to react to market volatility, and
possess decision making capacity to act on opportunities or to mitigate
risk.
```
```
6.9 In identifying the functions performed in a related party commodity
transaction, it is also relevant to consider the capabilities provided by the
commodity marketing/trading entity. Such capabilities include decision-
making capacity (for example, developing trading and business strategy,
making decisions about assumption and control of risks) and capacity to
exercise authority.
```
```
Nature of commodity and assets used by commodity marketing/trading entity
```
```
6.10 The functions of a commodity marketing/trading entity will also depend
on the commodity that it deals in and the specific market characteristics
for that commodity.
```
```
6.11 Commodity market is subject to supply and demand imbalances,
industry cycles, price volatility, etc. The physical nature of the
commodities also makes them unique. For example:
```

```
(a) The physical attributes, characteristics and quality could vary for a
particular commodity. Customer requirements would likewise vary
for a particular commodity and different commodities.
```
```
(b) Commodities’ physical properties may be affected by
environmental factors. For example, certain commodity must be
kept dry and if contaminated by moisture, it cannot be used for
production. It may also have a shelf life and cannot be stored for
an indefinite period. The short shelf life and storage requirements
make warehousing/storing the commodity challenging.
```
```
(c) Different commodities may require very different logistics and
handling, depending on the physical characteristics and market
requirements.
```
```
(d) Commodities are subject to different pricing. For the same
commodity, pricing bases could also vary across different regions
in the world.
```
6.12 Depending on the liquidity of a particular commodity market, country
political risks, macroeconomic conditions and so on, a commodity
marketing/trading entity may have different arrangements in place for
different commodities that it trades and the markets it buys from and sells
into.

6.13 Given the complexity of the commodity market and the characteristics of
commodities, specialised expertise is necessary to conduct commodity
marketing/trading activities and to manage risks arising from such
activities. Such specialised expertise would include knowledge and
experience on logistics and financing. The examples below illustrate
specialised expertise is essential in optimising the returns on a
commodity. More examples are provided in Appendix A.

```
Example 4
```
```
With deep industry specialised knowledge, a commodity
marketing/trading entity may:
 Develop both short and long term models to understand the steel
industry and where and what type of iron ore inputs will be required
in that industry within a country.
```
```
 Make comparisons across different iron ore consuming industries
and across a broad number of countries in order to determine where
it is possible to realise higher premium (or lower discount) for the
traded commodity.
```
```
 Provide input back into the mining operations to ensure the mine is
producing the right quality and quantity of iron ore (within context of
the available resource) to market to customers.
```

```
As a result, the commodity marketing/trading entity is enabling the mine
to best use its expertise to optimise production and plan resource and
logistics. This would help in reducing operating costs for the mine and
facilitating the objective of achieving maximum value from the resource.
```
```
Example 5
```
```
The quality and characteristics of commodities from suppliers are
variable. To match customer specifications, a commodity
marketing/trading entity may blend different grades of refined oil, blend
ore with different purity levels from various suppliers, etc. To do so, it
needs to identify when and where blending can take place and know
where other blending ingredients can be acquired, and thus, meeting
customer specifications at competitive prices while enhancing its
profitability.
```
6.14 In addition to know-how generated from specialised expertise, a
commodity marketing/trading entity may develop valuable marketing
intangibles, such as relationships with customers and suppliers. They
are key to doing business in commodities markets. When market is not
liquid, opportunities are often identified through relationships with
customers and suppliers. Strong and trusted relationships provide
valuable real time market intelligence of market conditions, global flows
and demand-supply patterns. Market intelligence is important to identify
deal opportunities, forecast demand and supply, better understand ever-
varying customer specifications and requirements, etc. Relationships
also facilitate control of risks (see Table 1 and Table 2 under paragraph

6. 19 ).

6.15 A commodity marketing/trading entity may also have developed
advantageous logistical know-how or software and other tools that it
uses in conducting its commodity marketing/trading activities.

6.16 The use of various intangibles by the commodity marketing/trading entity
must be considered when determining the arm’s length transfer price.

Risks assumed by commodity marketing/trading entity

6.17 It is necessary to analyse the risks that have been assumed in a related
party commodity transaction, the risk control functions performed and
the parties that assumed those risks. To assume a risk for transfer
pricing purpose, the party must be able to control the risk and has the
financial capacity to assume the risk.

6.18 Risks cover those generated directly by commodity marketing/trading
activities (“internal risks”) and those not generated directly by commodity
marketing/trading activities (“external risks”). External risks are caused
by factors, such as economic environment, political and regulatory
events, competition, technological advance, or social and environmental


```
changes. Such factors could create global supply/demand imbalances.
External risks are as relevant as internal risks. The ability of a commodity
marketing/trading entity to face, respond to and mitigate external risks is
likely to be a necessary condition for the business to remain competitive.
```
6.19 Table 1 below gives some examples of risks relating to commodity
marketing/trading activities. Table 2 gives some examples on how those
risks may be controlled.

```
Table 1 : Examples of risks relating to commodity marketing/trading
activities
```
```
Risks Description
Excess
production
risk
```
```
This risk may arise when the commodity marketing/trading
entity purchases the full production of a commodity. The
excess production may also result in the commodity
marketing/trading entity being exposed to inventory risk and
quality risk arising from stockpiles.
```
```
The commodity marketing/trading entity may need to find
alternative buyers to sell the excess or sell it in the spot
market.
```
```
Where the commodity marketing/trading entity assumes such
risk, it bears the consequential losses and costs relating to
shipping, storage, damage to the quality of the commodity,
etc.
```
```
Shortfall
production
risk
```
```
This risk may arise when the commodity marketing/trading
entity purchases the full production of a commodity.
```
```
With the shortfall in production, the commodity
marketing/trading entity may not be able to fulfil customers’
requirements. It may need to find alternative sources or buy
from the spot market to fulfil supply commitments to
customers.
```
```
Where the commodity marketing/trading entity assumes such
risk, it bears the consequential losses and costs from failure
to supply.
```
```
Customer
non-
performance
risk
```
```
When customers reject the delivery of the cargoes or do not
fulfil their part of the contracts, the commodity
marketing/trading entity may need to find alternative buyers
to sell the cargoes or sell them in the spot market. Where the
commodity marketing/trading entity assumes such risk, it
bears the consequential losses and costs.
```

```
Risks Description
```
Supply risk This risk may arise from the commodity marketing/trading
entity’s failure to deliver cargoes to its customers. This risk
may be due to shortfall production risk.

Inventory risk Where the commodity marketing/trading entity takes
ownership of the commodity, it may be exposed to inventory
risk. Such risk could arise for example, from excess
production or customer non-performance.

Price risk The commodity marketing/trading entity may be exposed to
price risk, for example when the quotation period between its
customers and supplier is different or when the prices for the
customers and supplier are referenced to different indices
due to different markets.

Market risk This risk arises from market changes in supply and demand
for a commodity. This risk has similar effect as excess
production risk and shortfall production risk.

Credit risk This risk arises from customers’ default or delay in payment.
This risk may affect the commodity marketing/trading entity’s
cash flow.

Contract risk This risk arises from different contractual terms between
customers and supplier. For examples, different international
commercial terms (“incoterm”), different quotation period,
different threshold for specification variations before penalty
clause is invoked, etc.

Logistics risk
The commodity marketing/trading entity may be exposed to
the risk of changes in delivery schedules or shipping quote in
the contract being different from the actual shipping price it
has to pay where the commodity is sold on delivered
incoterms.

Demurrage
risk

```
This risk arises from failure to unload from a vessel or load a
vessel within the allotted time period, resulting in cost being
charged by ship owner or freighter of a ship. This risk may be
due to excess production risk or shortfall production risk.
```
Quality risk The commodity marketing/trading entity may have
uncertainty on the quality of commodity it will receive. This
may result in not meeting customers’ requirements and
possibility of penalty or cargo rejection.


```
Risks Description
```
Foreign
exchange
risk

```
A commodity marketing/trading entity may be exposed to
foreign exchange risk, for example, when its purchases and
sales of a commodity are denominated in different currencies.
```
External risks A commodity marketing/trading entity may be exposed to
external market events which are beyond its control, such as
economic environment, political and regulatory events,
competition, technological advance, or social and
environmental changes.

```

```
Controls Description
```
Customer
base

```
Expand and diversify customer base to manage excess
production or supply.
```
Customer
relationship

```
Maintain and establish good customer relationship. For
example, good customer relationship may facilitate the
commodity marketing/trading entity in renegotiating timing of
shipments to manage excess or shortfall in production.
```
Optionality Provide better optionality to enhance margins, such as
satisfying customers order from different sources,
customising the cargo to a customer’s need, blending
different grades of the commodity, blending commodity from
different locations, breaking up the cargo into smaller
shipments or accepting specific payment terms.

Global supply
book

```
Manage a global supply book to increase flexibility in diverting
cargoes, blending varying qualities of commodity, managing
excess or shortfall in production, managing changes in
demand and supply, etc.
```
Portfolio
trading
strategy

```
Maintain a portfolio of varied supply sources with different
contract pricing terms and contract lengths for flexibility to
manage diverse customers’ needs, customer non-
performance, and supply and demand imbalances through
diversion of cargoes and arbitrage, etc.
```
Spot trading
Use spot market strategically.

Market
experience

```
Use experience to obtain best possible outcome given market
opportunities. For example, market arbitrage.
```

```
Controls Description
Analytical
tools
```
```
Use a variety of tools to manage risk. For example, use credit
checks prior to sales, enhanced receivables management,
insurance products, letters of credit, etc. to control credit risk.
```
```
Capability
development
```
```
 Develop in-house shipping and logistics expertise to
manage risks relating to freight and optimise freight.
 Develop deep portfolio structuring expertise.
 Develop functional capabilities in finance and accounting,
systems risk management.
```
```
Hedging Employ sophisticated hedging techniques to manage the
financial and foreign exchange risks arising from market price
volatility.
```
```
Price
adjustment
mechanism
```
```
Structure price review clauses in agreements to facilitate
price adjustment so that over time the price for commodities
supplied under the agreements reflects changes in the
market.
```
6.20 Where a commodity marketing/trading entity contractually assumes
certain risks, an analysis of risk assumption is required. Where the
analysis indicates that the commodity marketing/trading entity indeed
controls those risks and has the financial capacity to assume those risks,
those risks will be allocated to the commodity marketing/trading entity for
transfer pricing purpose, and thus, it must be compensated
appropriately. The compensation will usually be derived from the
consequences of being allocated risk, and therefore the commodity
marketing/trading entity will be entitled to receive the upside benefits and
to incur the downside costs.

```
Example 6
```
```
Commodity marketing/trading entity, Company A, claims that it is
exposed to price risk of a commodity. An analysis of risk assumption
indicates that:
 Company A buys the commodity from its related party in one market
and sells it in other markets. The price volatility among the different
pricing bases across various markets exposes Company A to price
risk
```
```
 Under the terms and conditions between Company A and its related
party, the price risk is not passed back to the related party.
```
```
 Company A determines the volume sold at different pricing bases.
Company A also monitors the price risk closely and hedges the
exposures through certain derivatives where appropriate.
```

```
 Company A has the expertise to evaluate the risk, makes decisions
in relation to the risk, and has the financial capacity to bear the risk.
```
```
Based on the analysis, Company A is said to assume price risk.
```
6.21 Analysis of risk assumption should also take into consideration the
extent to which any shared risks are borne by the commodity
marketing/trading entity. In some instances, the commodity
marketing/trading entity and its related party to the related party
commodity transaction assume a specific risk. They together control the
specific risk and each has the financial capacity to assume their share of
the specific risk, then that assumption of risk by each party should be
respected.

```
Example 7
```
```
Under an agreement between a commodity marketing/trading entity,
Company A, and its related producer, demurrage risk is contractually
assumed by both parties. If there is a failure to load or unload a ship, any
charge payable to the ship owner is to be shared between Company A
and its related producer.
```
```
Company A’s functions include planning, scheduling, logistics and other
functions to ensure ships are available when needed, ships arrive at the
right time, there is no idle ship at the port and ships are loaded and
discharged within the time agreed, etc. Such functions ensure incidence
of demurrage is minimised. Company A also has shipping and long term
charter arrangements to fulfil shipping requirement.
```
```
The analysis of risk assumption found that:
 Both parties together control the demurrage risk,
 The contractual assumption of demurrage risk is consistent with the
conduct of both parties, and
 Each party has the financial capacity to assume its share of the
demurrage risk.
```
```
Therefore, the assumption of demurrage risk by Company A and its
related producer should be respected.
```
6.22 Even if a commodity marketing/trading entity does not assume certain
risks associated with the related party commodity transaction, it may
perform control functions relating to those risks assumed by the other
party to the transaction. Such risk control functions need to be taken into
account in determining the appropriate amount of compensation to the
commodity marketing/trading entity.


```
Example 8
```
```
The fact is the same as Example 7 in paragraph 6. 21 except that under
the agreement, only the related producer contractually assumes
demurrage risk and bears any charge payable to the ship owner.
```
```
The analysis of risk assumption found that:
 Both parties together control the demurrage risk,
 The contractual assumption of demurrage risk by the related
producer is consistent with its conduct, and
 The related producer has the financial capacity to assume the
demurrage risk.
```
```
The fact that Company A also exercises control over the demurrage risk
does not affect the assumption of that risk by the related producer.
Company A needs to be compensated appropriately for performing risk
control functions to mitigate the demurrage risk.
```
Taking title to commodity

6.23 By taking title to a commodity, a commodity marketing/trading entity is
able to trade as a principal and optimise returns on the commodity
through various strategies (such as adopting a portfolio trading strategy,
reallocating and directing commodity to meet the needs of customers,
blending, etc.) for its own account. It receives upside benefits and bears
downside consequences from assuming various risks. Taking title to the
commodity also enables the commodity marketing/trading entity to
control those risks (see Table 1 and Table 2 in paragraph 6. 19 ).

6.24 Where a commodity marketing/trading entity does not take title to a
commodity, its functions and risks may be more limited relative to trading
as a principal for the commodity. Notwithstanding that it does not take
title to the commodity, a commodity marketing/trading entity performing
marketing functions may well contribute significant economic value to its
related party such as in building strong customer networks and access
to timely customers’ information that facilitate the subsequent deal
making. See example in paragraph 5. 3.

6.25 A commodity marketing/trading entity may buy and sell commodity on a
back-to-back basis taking “flash title” to the commodity. While this may
indicate a limited suite of inventory-related functions and risks in some
cases, it may not necessarily be so in other cases. In these other cases,
a commodity marketing/trading entity typically enters into a purchasing
arrangement with its supplier based on certain terms that are fixed and
applied consistently to all it purchases. The commodity marketing/trading
entity has a number of choices about the terms on which to sell the
commodity to its customers – (1) using contractual terms that have the
effect of passing title or risk (or both) to its customer immediately after it
receives it, (2) using contractual terms that pass title and risk at a later


```
point in the supply chain, or (3) applying a range of different contractual
terms depending on the commodity, market, shipping terms, etc. If the
commodity marketing/trading entity decides to take “flash title” under (1),
it is a consequence of how the market operates, the choices available to
it or how it manages its exposure to risk, rather than a decision to align
the supplier’s and customer’s contractual terms. Consequently, while
taking “flash title” may limit the commodity marketing/trading entity’s
inventory risk, it is unlikely to have an impact on its functions and
assumption of other risks listed in Table 1 in paragraph 6.19.
```
6.26 In summary, taking title to a commodity alone is not a sufficient
differentiator to determine the overall functional profile of a commodity
marketing/trading entity. A commodity marketing/trading entity could
create significant economic value even though it does not take title to the
commodity. Likewise, taking “flash title” is not indicative of limited
functions and risks. All relevant facts and circumstances need to be
taken into account in determining the actual functional profile.

Economic value created by commodity marketing/trading entity

6.27 Due consideration must be given to the contribution that the commodity
marketing/trading entity makes to the value creation when determining
the arm’s length transfer price for a related party commodity transaction
as such contribution is defined by the intensity of activities undertaken
(taking into account assets used and risks assumed).

6.28 Contribution to value creation is not based on the number of functions
performed, but the economic significance of those functions in terms of
their frequency, nature and value to the respective parties to the
transaction that is important.

6.29 Contribution to value creation is also not dependent on whether the
commodity marketing/trading entity takes title to a commodity. As
highlighted in the earlier paragraphs, a commodity marketing/trading
entity could create significant economic value even if it does not take title
or take “flash title” to the commodity.

6.30 See Appendix A for more examples.

Transfer pricing methods to price actual related party commodity
transactions

6.31 Every effort should be made to price the actual related party commodity
transaction as accurately delineated using the five methods set out in
the IRAS Transfer Pricing Guidelines:


```
Traditional transaction
methods
```
```
Transactional profits
methods
1) Comparable uncontrolled
price (“CUP”) method
2) Resale price method
3) Cost plus method
```
```
4) Transactional profit split method
5) Transactional net margin method
(“TNMM”) with profit level
indicators (“PLI”) such as:
 Operating profit margin (“OM”)
 Full cost mark-up
 Value-added cost mark-up
 Berry ratio
 Return on asset
```
```
6.32 When selecting the most appropriate method to price a related party
commodity transaction, besides considering the availability of reliable
independent comparables, it is important to consider industry practices.
Common industry practices provide indications of what independent
parties would have agreed to pay or receive under comparable
circumstances.
```
6.33 It should not be assumed that a commodity marketing/trading entity is
always the tested party. If the functional analysis of the actual related
party commodity transaction indicates that the related party with which
the commodity marketing/trading entity transacts has less complex
functional profile, the related party could well be the tested party.

```
CUP method
```
```
6.34 Under the CUP method, the arm’s length price for a related party
commodity transaction may be determined by reference to:
```
```
(a) Comparable independent party transactions and
```
```
(b) Comparable independent party arrangements represented by the
quoted price (“quoted price CUP”).
```
```
Comparable independent party transactions
```
```
6.35 Where comparable independent party transactions are available, the
prices in such transactions can be used as a reference for establishing
the arm’s length price for the related party commodity transaction.
```
```
Example 9
```
```
(a) Commission rates in comparable independent party contracts may
be used as reference for pricing commodity marketing/trading
activities involving an agent or marketing as in the example in
paragraph 5. 3 depending on the actual facts of the case.
```

```
(b) Certain commodities may be priced based on a percentage of
London Metal Exchange (“LME”) price. The percentage of LME in
comparable independent party contracts may be used as reference
for determining the percentage.
```
```
Quoted price CUPs
```
6.36 Quoted price CUP is appropriate where quoted price is widely and
routinely used in the ordinary course of business in the industry to
negotiate prices for independent party transactions comparable to the
related party commodity transaction.^6 Accordingly, depending on the
facts and circumstances of each case, quoted prices can be considered
as a reference for pricing the sale or purchase of a commodity between
a commodity marketing/trading entity (for example, a full risk-taking
entrepreneur described in paragraph 5. 4 ) and its related parties.

6.37 The term “quoted price” refers to the price of the commodity in the
relevant period obtained in an international or domestic commodity
exchange market. A quoted price also includes prices obtained from
recognised and transparent price reporting or statistical agencies,
independent brokers or from governmental price-setting agencies,
where such indexes are used as a reference by independent parties to
determine prices in transactions between them.

```
Example 10
```
```
Jet fuel, gasoline and diesel can be priced based on the relevant MOPS
indices (i.e. Means of Platts Singapore).
```
6.38 The use of quoted price should also be consistent with the industry
norms. For example, in the liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) industry, pricing
could be based on a combination of indices (i.e. hybrid contracts or
hybrid pricing formula) rather than a single index.

```
Example 11
```
```
 LNG prices in Asia Pacific are commonly indexed to crude oil,
example, Japanese Crude Cocktail (“JCC”)
 LNG supply from North America is indexed to Henry Hub (“HH”), i.e.
a gas price
 LNG Hybrid contracts could involve using a formula that combines
gas price with an oil indexed supply. For example, 70% oil-linked +
30% HH-linked
```
6.39 If there are different indices or different ways of using indices to price a
commodity in the industry, it is important that the commodity
marketing/trading entity explains in detail with proper documentation the

(^6) Reference: Paragraphs 2.18 to 2.22 of OECD 2017 Transfer Pricing Guidelines


```
basis of using one index or formula over another index or formula to price
the commodity.
```
```
Comparability adjustments
```
6.40 To apply the CUP method reliably, the economically relevant
characteristics of the related party commodity transaction and the
independent party transactions or the quoted price CUPs need to be
comparable. Where there are differences and such differences
materially affect the price of the related party commodity transaction
being examined, reasonably accurate comparability adjustments should
be made to ensure that the economically relevant characteristics of the
transactions are comparable. For commodities, the economically
relevant characteristics include physical features and quality of the
commodity, and the contractual terms of the related party commodity
transaction (such as volumes traded, period of the arrangements, the
timing and terms of delivery, transportation, insurance and foreign
currency terms).

6.41 When applying quoted price CUPs to determine prices of commodity,
there must have a high degree of commodity comparability. In contrast,
when applying comparable independent party transactions to determine
pricing of commodity marketing/trading activities of an agent or relating
to marketing (see paragraph 6.35), a greater emphasis is placed on
functional comparability than commodity comparability as minor
commodity differences are less likely to have a material effect on the
pricing as they do on prices of commodity.

6.42 Comparability adjustments should be considered only if they are
expected to increase the reliability of the results. For example, physical
volume of a commodity traded per contract (or transaction) is
significantly smaller than the total volume traded on the exchange during
the day. If the difference in volume traded has no bearing on the quoted
price of the exchange, comparability adjustments need not be made.

6.43 Examples of comparability adjustments: 7

```
(a) Adjustment for product quality or metal content.
```
```
(b) Adjustment for different incoterms. If the quoted or indexed price is
a DAP price^8 while the incoterm of the related party commodity
transaction is FOB^9 , an appropriate shipping and other relevant
cost is required to be adjusted against the quoted or indexed price
to convert it into a FOB price.
```
(^7) See examples in paragraphs 2.23 to 2.26 of OECD 2017 Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
(^8) DAP refers to the incoterm, Delivered at Place (previously, DES or Delivered Ex-Ship).
(^9) FOB refers to the incoterm, Free On Board.


```
(c) Adjustment for freight. Where the quoted or indexed price assumes
a specific physical location of the commodity at point of sale that is
different from the actual location of the related party commodity
transaction, a freight adjustment may be required for the cost of
transportation between the two locations. The adjustment may be
based on market reference freight pricing.
```
```
(d) Adjustment for premium or discount. Generally, in transactions
conducted by independent parties, a premium or discount may be
applied to the quoted price after negotiations. As such, it may be
necessary to factor in premium or discount that are consistent with
industry norms. They can be based on average market premium
earned on third party sales or common margins earned in the
industry.
```
```
Pricing date for commodity priced by reference to quoted price
```
6.44 Where the price for the sale or purchase of a commodity between a
commodity marketing/trading entity and its related parties is determined
by reference to the quoted price, a particularly relevant factor is the
pricing date. Pricing date refers to the specific time, date or time period
(example, a specified range of dates over which an average price is
determined) selected by the related parties to determine the price for the
commodity.

6.45 The commodity marketing/trading entity and its related parties must
ensure that they have reliable evidence of the pricing date agreed in the
related party commodity transaction at the time the transaction was
entered into and it is consistent with their actual conduct or with other
facts of the case. Examples of evidence of the pricing date are proposals
and acceptances, contracts or other documents setting out the terms of
the arrangements.

6.46 In the absence of such evidence or the agreed pricing date is
inconsistent with actual conduct, the commodity marketing/trading entity
and its related parties may face the risk of double taxation arising from
tax administrations deeming the pricing date for the related party
commodity transaction on the basis of the evidence available to the tax
administrations. This may be the date of shipment as evidenced by the
bill of lading or equivalent document depending on the means of
transport.^10

```
Difficulties in applying CUP method
```
6.47 Where the comparable independent party transactions produce a range
of prices, it may be difficult to arrive at a specific price that is the arm’s
length price. In such situation, an inter-quartile range or a full range (i.e.

(^10) See paragraph 2.22 of OECD 2017 Transfer Pricing Guidelines.


```
when all the points in the range are equally reliable) established from the
prices of such comparable independent party transactions could be
applied to determine the arm’s length price range for the related party
commodity transaction.
```
6.48 It may be difficult to find transactions between independent parties that
are similar enough to the related party commodity transaction. This is
especially so when agreements relating to commodity transactions are
usually highly confidential and are not publicly available. Furthermore,
commodity industry generally involves complex inter-company
structures and value chains that can make the use of CUP method
inappropriate. In such situations or when reasonably accurate
adjustment cannot be made without affecting the reliability of the CUP
method, it might be necessary to select another less direct method.

```
Example 12
```
A commodity marketing/trading entity, Company A, enters into an
agreement with a related company, Company B. Under the agreement,
Company B is responsible for purchasing Commodity Z, processing it
and on selling it to Company A under the strategic direction and within
the operating standards and procedures set by Company A. Company B
has limited risk while Company A assumes production risk (excess or
shortfall production risk), market risk, counterparty risk (supply risk,
customer non-performance risk, credit risk, etc.) and inventory risk.
Suppose based on a thorough functional analysis, Company B assumes
the role of a contract manufacturer.

Although the quoted price is available for Commodity Z, the need to
perform numerous or substantial adjustments, for example to account for
the risks assumed by Company A, may render using quoted price CUP
inappropriate and unreliable.

Based on the general rule for determining tested party, Company B is
considered the tested party as it has less complex functional analysis as
compared to Company A. Thus, it may be more appropriate to apply a
cost plus method or TNMM to determine the arm’s length compensation
for Company B.

Resale price method

6.49 This method is likely to be useful where the related party commodity
transaction involves marketing operations and market evidence also
shows that independent parties performing comparable operations are
remunerated by reference to sales values and earn a percentage
discount (or resale price margin or gross margin) from a sale price.

6.50 The commission rates available in comparable independent party
contracts (i.e. CUPs) can be considered as a reference for determining


```
the appropriate percentage discount. The percentage discount can also
be determined based on internal comparables or external comparables
obtained from commercial databases.
```
6.51 To the extent that the percentage discount could be reliably determined
based on internal or external comparables, in the absence of CUPs, this
approach may be considered for determining the arm’s length
compensation for a related party commodity transaction that involves an
agent and marketing functions (see paragraph 6. 35 ).

6.52 Where there are material differences in the related party commodity
transaction and independent party transactions that affect the gross
margins earned, comparability adjustments should be made to eliminate
such differences. For example, the commodity marketing/trading entity,
being the tested party, assumes credit risk. However, the comparable
CUPs selected do not assume credit risk. Reasonably accurate
comparability adjustments should be made to account for the
assumption of credit risk. For instance, third party data on pricing credit
risk could be used to determine the adjustments.

Cost-based transfer pricing methods

- Cost plus method
- TNMM with full cost mark-up as PLI

6.53 Cost-based transfer pricing methods, i.e. cost plus method and TNMM
with full cost mark-up as PLI, are appropriate where costs are a relevant
indicator of the value of the commodity marketing/trading activities
performed by the commodity marketing/trading entity in a related party
commodity transaction, taking into account assets used and risks
assumed. Typically, the methods are appropriate where the commodity
marketing/trading activities are services related which do not require
significant specialised expertise, risks assumption or risk control
functions relating to the commodity in the related party commodity
transaction. For example, the services as in paragraph 5. 2 depending on
the actual facts of the case. The arm’s length mark-up may reliably be
based on comparable independent service providers.

6.54 Cost-based transfer pricing methods may also be appropriate where the
related party commodity transaction involves contract or toll
manufacturing. See Example 12 in paragraph 6. 48.

6.55 The reliability of cost-based transfer pricing methods may be reduced
where the commodity marketing/trading activities performed by the
commodity marketing/trading entity in a related party commodity
transaction involve significant value, including decision-making capacity,
capacity to exercise authority, risks assumption or risk control functions.
These activities affect business outcomes and thus, their value to the
related parties may correlate to revenues or profits rather than costs.
Furthermore, if the commodity marketing/trading entity genuinely


```
assumes risks in the related party commodity transaction when
performing these activities, applying cost-based transfer pricing methods
may distort the transfer price as the commodity marketing/trading entity
is precluded from encountering upside or downside consequences of
risk outcomes, both of which should generally be expected of a risk
bearing entity. Depending on the facts and circumstances of such cases,
CUP method or transactional profit methods may be more appropriate.
```
Transactional profit split method

6.56 This method is appropriate where:

```
(a) The commodity marketing/trading entity’s interaction with its
related parties and their contributions to the related party
commodity transaction are highly inter-related and integrated.
```
```
(b) The commodity marketing/trading entity and its related parties
make unique and valuable contributions to the related party
commodity transaction.
```
```
(c) The existence of unique intangible assets makes it difficult to find
reliable comparables.
```
```
(d) The commodity marketing/trading entity and its related parties
share the assumption of one or more of the economically significant
risks in relation to the related party commodity transaction or the
parties assume the economically significant risks separately but
those risks are so closely inter-related or correlated that the playing
out of the risks of each party cannot reliably be evaluated
separately.
```
6.57 The transactional profit split method may be appropriate for global
trading of commodities by the commodity marketing/trading entity with
its related commodity trading entities as in Examples 1 and 2 in
paragraph 5. 4 depending on the actual fact of the case. This is further
illustrated in the example below:

```
Example 13
```
```
A commodity marketing/trading entity, Company A, and its related party,
Company B, perform high value commodity trading functions. Company
A is located in Asia Pacific and undertakes commodity trading and risk
management for the Asia Pacific region. Company B is located in North
America and undertakes commodity trading and risk management for
the America and Europe region. Both Company A and Company B trade
on commodities and arbitrage their positions through an integrated,
single, global trading book. Both companies work closely to optimise the
global profitability of the book. They also share the assumption of
economically significant risks relating to commodity trading. As such,
```

```
transactional profit split method can be considered. Traders’
remuneration of both companies may be considered an appropriate profit
splitting factor if it is directly linked to the profits (or losses) generated
from commodity trading.
```
TNMM with OM as PLI

6.58 TNMM with OM as PLI may be appropriate where sales is a relevant
indicator of the value of the functions performed by the commodity
marketing/trading entity, taking into account assets used and risks
assumed. The arm’s length OM may reliably be based on comparable
independent party transactions.

6.59 A commodity marketing/trading entity that conducts commodity trading
may purchase commodities from its related parties for resale and sales
is one indicator of the value of its trading activities. However, this does
not necessary mean TNMM with OM as PLI is appropriate. Relevant
considerations include:

```
(a) While TNMM with OM as PLI may be appropriate for distribution
activities, commodity trading entails more than just distribution
activities of buying and selling commodities for its related parties.
Commodity trading involves sourcing, collecting real time market
intelligence, managing logistics, optimising physical movement and
delivery of cargoes, determining commodity placement strategy,
sales and marketing, blending, storage, building and maintaining
customer relationships, managing risks and cash flows, financial
management, etc. Such activities are carried out with the objective
of optimising returns on the commodities for the business and
require specialised expertise. This method is, therefore, unlikely to
be reliable if the commodity marketing/trading entity makes
valuable contributions from its commodity trading with know-how
generated from specialised expertise.
```
```
(b) Where the commodity marketing/trading entity undertakes risk-
taking entrepreneurial activities, it assumes and takes on the
upside and downside consequences of risks arising from its
activities and bears the financial and other consequences. Applying
TNMM with OM as PLI may preclude the commodity
marketing/trading entity from receiving upside benefits and
incurring downside costs, both of which should generally be
expected of a risk bearing entity.
```
```
(c) Where the commodity marketing/trading entity undertaking
commodity trading has a complex functional analysis, it may be
difficult to identify reliable comparables or may entail numerous or
substantial adjustments to the comparables rendering TNMM
method with OM as PLI inappropriate and unreliable.
```

6.60 Considering the above, TNMM with OM as PLI is unlikely to be an
appropriate method to price valuable contributions and risk-taking
entrepreneurial activities in relation to commodity trading.

6.61 This method may, however, be considered in cases with limited buy-sell
activities and risks.

```
Example 14
```
```
A commodity marketing/trading entity, Company A, buys commodity
from related producers for sale to third parties on a back-to-back basis
taking “flash title” to the commodity. It conducts limited buy-sell activities,
such as identifying and negotiating sales opportunities and determining
sales volume and prices. It assumes limited inventory risk, price risk and
credit risk. As sales is a relevant indicator of the value of the functions
performed by Company A, TNMM with OM as PLI may be considered to
be an appropriate transfer pricing method where comparable
independent party transactions are available.
```
6.62 TNMM with OM as PLI may afford a practical solution to otherwise
insoluble transfer pricing problems when used sensibly with appropriate
adjustments to comparable independent party transactions to account
for differences.

```
Example 15
```
```
A commodity marketing/trading entity, Company A, buys commodity
from related producers for sale to third parties. It undertakes sales and
marketing activities (such as collating and analysing market intelligence,
maintaining customer databases, developing market strategy and sales
plan, analysing customer demand, etc.) and coordinates freight and
logistics. Company A bears the obligation to purchase all output from the
related producers and assumes freight risk, credit risk, customer non-
performance risk and limited price and foreign exchange risks. The
functional analysis indicates that Company A’s activities add value over
and above limited buy-sell activities.
```
```
TNMM with OM as PLI may afford a practical solution if comparable
independent party transactions are available and reasonably accurate
adjustments can be made. Suppose in this example, it is possible to
identify broadly comparable independent party transactions performing
similar functions and assuming similar risks as Company A and
supplying similar commodity as between Company A and the related
producers.
```
```
As Company A performs higher value-add functions and assumes higher
risks than the independent party transactions (example, in relation to
Company A’s obligation to purchase all output from the related
```

```
producers), comparability adjustments are necessary to obtain reliable
results.
```
```
If reasonably accurate comparability adjustments cannot be made
without affecting the reliability of the analysis, an OM range may be
considered to mitigate the level of inaccuracy of the adjustment to some
extent. Consideration is then required to determine where within the OM

TNMM with Berry ratio and value-added cost mark-up as PLI

6.63 Berry ratio (i.e. the ratio of gross profit to operating expenses) is
effectively a cost-based PLI. The considerations for appropriateness of
cost-based transfer pricing methods set out in the earlier paragraphs
apply equally to the application of Berry ratio.

6.64 Section 5 of IRAS Transfer Pricing Guidelines limits the use of Berry
ratio, for example to cases where the following circumstances in a
particular transaction are present:

```
(a) The taxpayer acts as an intermediary purchasing goods from
related parties and on-selling them to other related parties;
```
```
(b) The taxpayer does not perform any value-added functions other
than distribution relating to the products distributed;
```
```
(c) The value of the functions performed by the taxpayer is not affected
by the value of products distributed;
```
```
(d) There is a direct link between operating expenses and gross profits;
and
```
```
(e) The taxpayer does not employ any intangibles in the particular
transaction.
```
6.65 Essentially, Berry ratio relies on the presumption that the value of the
functions performed is proportional to the operating expenses and not to
sales. For instance, Berry ratio may be appropriate in a situation where
the commodity marketing/trading entity buys commodity from related
parties for resale to other related parties under back-to-back
arrangements taking “flash title”, and it does not bear any risk or perform
any value-added functions relating to the commodity other than
distributing the commodity. In such situation, operating expenses may
be a relevant indicator of the value of the commodity marketing/trading
entity’s functions performed.

6.66 Like Berry ratio, TNMM with value-added cost mark-up as PLI relies on
the presumption that the value of the functions performed is proportional
to the operating expenses and not to sales. Thus, the consideration for


```
applying TNMM with value-added cost mark-up as PLI will be the same
as that for Berry ratio.
```
6.67 Where the commodity marketing/trading entity’s costs of goods sold are
a key driver of its profitability and it has the ability to influence those costs
(example, through freight planning, scheduling and logistics functions)
or where the commodity marketing/trading entity incurs significant costs
in modifying, altering or bringing a commodity to the market, the Berry
ratio and value-added cost mark-up become unreliable as PLI.

TNMM with return on asset as PLI

6.68 Return on asset can be an appropriate PLI in cases where assets (rather
than costs or sales) are a better indicator of the value of the commodity
marketing/trading activities carried out in a related party commodity
transaction. This method may be appropriate for contract manufacturing
activities undertaken in a related party commodity transaction – see
Example 12 in paragraph 6. 48.

Other methods

6.69 If circumstances render another method, other than the above five
methods, to be more appropriate to establish the transfer price, the
commodity marketing/trading entity may apply that method provided the
outcome of that method satisfies the arm’s length principle. The
commodity marketing/trading entity would need to explain and maintain
proper transfer pricing documentation on the reasons for the method
being more suitable compared to the above five methods.

6.70 IRAS may use any of the five methods or other reasonable basis to
evaluate the appropriateness of the method applied by the commodity
marketing/trading entity.

**Arm’s length results** of related party commodity transactions

6.71 Once the most appropriate transfer pricing method has been selected, it
is applied to establish the arm’s length price for the related party
commodity transaction.

6.72 Where independent parties would in comparable circumstances enter
into substantially different commercial or financial relations than those
between the commodity marketing/trading entity and its related parties,
IRAS would determine the arm’s length price for the related party
commodity transaction based on the commercial or financial relations of
those independent parties.

6.73 IRAS recognises that a commodity marketing/trading entity and its
related parties may have the ability to enter into more varied


```
arrangements than independent parties. They may also conclude
transactions of a specific nature that are not encountered, or are very
rarely encountered, between independent parties. They may have done
so for sound business reasons. Thus, IRAS would not disregard a related
party commodity transaction or replace it with an alternative transaction
unless the transaction is commercially irrational.
```
6.74 In the event transfer pricing adjustments are made by IRAS, such
adjustments are subject to a surcharge of 5% regardless of whether
there is tax payable on the adjustments. 11

(^11) The imposition of surcharge on transfer pricing adjustment made by IRAS is provided in
section 34E of the Income Tax Act.


7 Transfer pricing documentation requirement

7.1 When a commodity marketing/trading entity meets certain conditions, it
is required to prepare transfer pricing documentation (“TP
documentation”) for its related party transactions. If it fails to do so, it
shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000.^12 Where a commodity
marketing/trading entity is not required to prepare TP documentation,
IRAS encourages it to document and explain its transfer pricing
arrangement.

7.2 To comply with the TP documentation requirement, IRAS expects a
commodity marketing/trading entity to include the following information
in its TP documentation:

```
(a) Economic circumstances and business strategies for the related
party commodity transaction.
```
```
(b) Details on how value is generated by the MNE group as a whole,
the inter-dependencies of the functions performed by the
commodity marketing/trading entity and its related parties with the
rest of the group and the contribution that the commodity
marketing/trading entity and its related parties make to that value
creation.
```
```
(c) A thorough functional analysis, including a detailed analysis on
risks assumption and how those risks are managed and controlled.
```
```
(d) Reliable evidence (such as actual examples on risk materialisation)
and document to support the commodity marketing/trading entity’s
assumption and management of risks. It is possible that a
commodity marketing/trading entity assumes certain risks but the
effect of those risks is not apparent in its financial statements. This
may be due to the commodity marketing/trading entity has
effectively managed them or the risks have not been played out. In
such situation, the commodity marketing/trading entity must be
able to explain in detail with documentation how it manages and
controls those risks.
```
```
(e) Price-setting policy, including the appropriate transfer pricing
method used, basis of selecting the method, and information and
document needed to justify the pricing.
```
```
(f) Where CUP method is applied, information is needed to justify
pricing based on the comparable independent party transactions or
quoted price CUPs, as well as any other relevant information, such
as:
```
(^12) The TP documentation requirement is provided in section 34F of the Income Tax Act
following the rules prescribed in the Income Tax (Transfer Pricing Documentation) Rules
2018.


```
 Pricing formulas used,
 Third party end-customer agreements,
 Premium or discount applied,
 Supply chain information,
 Information prepared for non-tax purposes,
 If there are different indices or different ways of using indices
to price a commodity in the industry, detailed explanation with
proper documentation on the basis of using one index or
formula over another index or formula to price the commodity,
and
 Reliable evidence of the pricing date agreed in the related party
commodity transaction at the time the transaction was entered
into and it is consistent with their actual conduct or with other
facts of the case.
```
```
(g) Comparison of terms and conditions agreed between the
commodity marketing/trading entity and its related parties with
industry practices and terms and conditions agreed between
independent parties, and the basis for the difference.
```
```
(h) Information and document needed to justify the comparability
adjustments, such as reasons for the adjustments being
considered appropriate, how they were calculated, how they
changed the results for each comparable and how the adjustment
improves comparability. For example, if comparability adjustment
is made for the assumption of risks or performance of certain
functions, information and document relating to the basis of such
comparability adjustment must be provided.
```
7.3 It is a good practice for the commodity marketing/trading entity to set up
a process to establish, monitor and review its transfer prices.


8 Avoiding and resolving transfer pricing dispute

8.1 When a commodity marketing/trading entity suffers double taxation from
adjustments made by IRAS or a foreign tax authority on the transfer
prices of its related party commodity transactions, it can choose to
resolve the issue through:

```
(a) Taking legal remedies in the jurisdiction in which the transfer pricing
adjustments are made; and/ or
```
```
(b) Requesting IRAS to resolve the double taxation through the Mutual
Agreement Procedure (“MAP”).
```
8.2 The commodity marketing/trading entity may also choose to avoid
transfer pricing disputes by applying for an Advance Pricing
Arrangement (“APA”) for its related party commodity transactions for
future years.

Appendix A **–** Illustrations on economic value of commodity
marketing/trading activities

```
Illustration 1
Commodity marketing/trading entity is a risk-taking entrepreneur
```
This example illustrates how a commodity marketing/trading entity operating as
a risk-taking entrepreneur and taking title to the commodity could bring value to
the supply chain.

Within an MNE group, a producer in Country X (“Producer X”) produces a
commodity (“Commodity A”) which are used by numerous customers in several
countries (“Customers”).

Producer X is prone to production issues resulting in irregular production
volume. When there is a shortfall in production, Producer X has to source for
Commodity A from the spot market or from its competitors to meet Customers’
requirements. When there is excess production, Producer X has to store the
excess production or dispose of the excess production in the spot market or to
its competitors. In both situations, it bears the consequential losses (example,
buying and selling Commodity A at unattractive prices) and costs (example,
demurrage charges and storage cost).

Customers require adequate and reliable supply of Commodity A to ensure
continued operation of their plants. Their plants cannot be shut down as it will
affect the quality of the products and is also costly to restart them. Customers
operate their plants with different capabilities and size. Furthermore, with
different supply and demand dynamics across their various locations, their
requirements for Commodity A are not homogenous.

To address Producer X’s production issue and to ensure the value of
Commodity A is maximised, the MNE group set up a commodity
marketing/trading entity in Singapore (“SG Entity”) to conduct commodity
trading activities.

SG Entity purchases Commodity A from Producer X under an arrangement
where:

```
Producer X SG Entity
Sells full amount of its production
bound for international sales to SG
Entity
```
```
Commits to acquire the same from
Producer X
```
```
Secures future sales for its
production at an agreed reference
price index
```
```
Takes title to Commodity A
```

```
Producer X SG Entity
Not required to perform any
additional marketing or risk functions
```
```
Fully responsible for all marketing,
trading and risk functions, including
finding customers and maintaining
the market for Commodity A
```
SG Entity sells Commodity A to Customers under a combination of:

 Term agreements – where the grade, volume and delivery schedule for
Commodity A is agreed for a period of time (example, one to five years)
and there is an agreed reference price index and quotation period to set the
price. Each customer would have different terms.

 Spot agreements – where each cargo is offered to the market and the price
is fixed, set by tender or set by an agreed reference price index.

The economic value of SG Entity’s activities is illustrated based on three events
using the arrangements with Producer X and Customers.

```
Event 1 – Shortfall in production
Due to some production issue, Producer X is unable to produce Commodity
A at a volume that it has forecasted.
```
```
Producer X
With the arrangement with SG Entity, Producer X does not have to source for
Commodity A to fulfil Customers’ requirements or bear any consequential
losses and costs arising from the shortfall in its production.
```
```
Customers
With the agreements with SG Entity, Customers are not affected by the
shortfall in supply and their operations are not affected.
```
```
SG Entity
SG Entity takes on the responsibility of fulfilling Customers’ agreements and
manages this risk by developing a term/spot sale strategy to mitigate the risk
of over committing Commodity A to Customers. It responds to the
performance risk from shortfall in production under the agreements with
Producer X and Customers through various ways such as:
```
```
 Develops a term/spot sale strategy to mitigate the risk of over committing
Commodity A to Customers.
```
```
 Diverts the ship which is intended to load Commodity A from Producer X
to other use and reschedules a ship to Producer X at a later time. In doing
so, SG Entity avoids or minimises demurrage charges.
```

```
Event 1 – Shortfall in production
```
 Finds alternative sources and uses spot market strategically to fulfil
Customers’ requirements. For example, with its good relationship with
certain customers, SG Entity may renegotiate timing of shipments to
these customers and divert the shipments meant for these customers to
meet Customers’ requirements.

 Uses its commodity trading knowhow to adapt and respond to unforeseen
changes in production (example, reduce spot sales) and to utilise its
established position in the market to respond quickly to unplanned
changes in production (example, rescheduling deliveries among
customers) in order to manage its supply risk to Customers.

SG Entity bears the consequential losses and costs arising from unscheduled
purchases and ship diversions.

Economic value of SG Entity’s activities to the group
Producer X is alleviated from the risk and consequential losses and costs
arising from the shortfall in its production to focus on its core production-
related risks. If Producer X bears the demurrage costs, it benefits from the
action by SG Entity to avoid or minimise demurrage charges.

SG Entity maintains trusting relationships with Customers by assuring them
of adequate supply of Commodity A under their agreements with SG Entity.

SG Entity maximises the value of the commodity even in distress time:

 By diverting shipment, SG Entity avoids losses from buying Commodity
A at unattractive prices.

 By having a term and spot placement strategy and a diversified customer
base, SG entity has flexibility to deal with production shortfalls without
being exposed to additional risks from purchasing Commodity A from the
market.

```
Event 2 – Excess in production
```
Producer X produced Commodity A in excess of SG Entity’s agreements with
Customers.

Producer X
With the arrangement with SG Entity, Producer X does not have to manage
the excess production or bear any consequential losses and costs.


```
Event 2 – Excess in production
```
SG Entity
SG Entity takes on the responsibility of selling the excess production. It
responds to the excess production or inventory risk and quality risk arising
from the excess production through various ways such as:

 Redirects ship to Producer X to avert a stock pile situation. In doing so,
SG Entity saves on storage costs for the excess production and
addresses Producer X’s storage constraints.

 Uses its diverse and geographically differentiated customer base and the
spot market to strategically sell the excess production. For example,
through its relationship with other customers, SG Entity may sell
additional shipments to other customers in the spot market. In doing so,
SG Entity avoids damage to Commodity A as certain commodities may
have a short shelf life.

 Takes advantage of optionality, such as breaking up the excess
production into smaller shipments to create sales opportunities to smaller
customers.

 Uses its commodity trading knowhow to adapt and respond to unforeseen
changes in production and to utilise its established position in the market
to respond quickly to unplanned changes in production in order to
manage excess production risk.

SG Entity bears the consequential losses and costs arising from unscheduled
sales and ship diversions.

Economic value of SG Entity’s activities to the group
Producer X is alleviated from the risk and consequential losses and costs
from the excess production to focus on its core production-related risks.
Producer X benefits from the action by SG Entity to avoid or minimise its
storage costs.

SG Entity maximises the value of the commodity even in distress time:

 By diverting shipment, SG Entity avoids losses from selling Commodity A
at unattractive prices.

 By regularly trading in the market, both on the purchasing and sales
sides, SG Entity is able to buy or sell additional tonnage without causing
suspicion in the market that Producer X has production issue. If Producer
X sells the excess production, it may raise suspicion within the market
that it is under pressure to sell the excess production. This may result in
a lower price being negotiated as Producer X may be viewed as in
distress.


```
Event 3 – Customer non-performance
```
Due to changes in demand for Customers’ products, Customers do not
require as much Commodity A as produced by Producer X.

Producer X
With the arrangement with SG Entity, Producer X does not have to manage
customer non-performance risk or bear any consequential losses and costs

SG Entity
SG Entity takes on the responsibility of dealing with Customers rejecting the
shipment and defaulting on their agreements. It responds to customer non-
performance risk through various ways such as:

 Performs due diligence of Customers’ credit risk to mitigate credit risk.

 Diverts shipment to other customers.

 Takes similar measures as in Event 2 to sell the excess supply.

It bears the consequential losses and costs arising from unscheduled sales
and ship diversions.

Economic value of SG Entity’s activities to the group
Producer X is alleviated from the risk and consequential losses and costs
arising from customer non-performance.

SG Entity maximises the value of the commodity as in Event 2.


```
Illustration 2
Commodity marketing/trading entity performs marketing functions
```
This example illustrates how the marketing activities of a commodity
marketing/trading entity could bring value to the supply chain even if it does not
take title to the commodity.

A producer in Country Y (Producer Y) produces Commodities A and B.
Producer Y operates a capital intensive business that requires long term
production planning and requires operations to be conducted at or close to
capacity to remain viable.

Commodities A and B are the same commodity type but have different quality
specifications and may be considered imperfect substitutes for each other.
They are bulk commodities and are difficult to store or stockpile in significant
quantities. Value of Commodities A and B is, thus, maximised where production
is consistent and sold contemporaneously into the market.

Entity Z, a Singapore commodity marketing/trading entity related to Producer
Y, conducts marketing activities for Commodities A and B to Customers located
in the broader Asian region. Customers purchase Commodities A and B on a
delivered basis in the seaborne market. The objective of the marketing activities
is to maintain volume throughput for each commodity and concurrently achieve
best possible price for each commodity. Entity Z does not take title to the
product and as such does not bear inventory risk. Despite not taking title, the
remit of Entity Z is to find buyers at an appropriate price for the commodity mix
that is produced by Producer Y.

The arrangement between Producer Y and Entity Z is as follows:

```
Producer Y Entity Z
Produces Commodities A and B at
operational capacity
```
```
Commits to obtaining best possible
price for production of Commodities A
and B in accordance with Producer
Y’s Production Plan
```
```
Enters into contractual agreements
for the sale of Commodities A and B
```
```
Does not take title to Commodities A
and B
```
```
Delegates all sales and marketing
related functions to Entity Z
```
```
Responsible for
 Developing and maintaining
market for Commodities A and B
 Developing and maintaining
customer relationships
 Developing marketing strategy
across Commodities A and B and
across Customers in various
geographical locations
```

```
Producer Y Entity Z
 Analysing pricing dynamics and
negotiating prices for
Commodities A and B to
maximise their value
 Ascertaining credit worthiness of
Customers
 Planning and managing logistics
associated with selling a bulk
commodity in the seaborne
market
```
```
Seeks to ensure that where possible
price and volume risk, inventory risk,
credit risk and logistics risk are
managed and mitigated
```
```
Responsible for
 Managing risks directly
associated with its marketing
functions
 Providing recommendations to
Producer Y in relation to the price,
volume, inventory, credit, and
logistics risks
```
The economic value of Entity Z’s activities is illustrated based on three events.

```
Event 1 – Additional production
Producer Y has increased capacity and production of Commodity A has been
increased by 20%.
```
```
With the additional production of Commodity A, Entity Z must:
 Identify new customers and/or seek additional sales volumes to existing
customers for Commodity A,
 Ensure that demand for Commodity B is not compromised,
 Ensure credit considerations are not compromised,
 Ensure customer relations are maintained,
 Maximise price across all commodities, and
 Manage the increased volume and complexity of the logistics function
associated with increased seaborne sales volumes.
```
```
Event 2 – Fall in demand
Weaker economic conditions in key markets have resulted in a decrease in
demand for both Commodity A and Commodity B.
```
```
With the fall in demand for Commodities A and B, Entity Z must:
 Ensure that throughput of volume and commodity optimisation are
maintained while prices in the given market is maintained, and
```

```
Event 2 – Fall in demand
 Manage trade-off between maintaining volume and (i) discounted prices,
(ii) credit terms, (iii) stockpiling costs and/or (iv) reducing production.
```
```
Event 3 – Customer non-performance
Weaker economic conditions in key markets have resulted in customer
financial stress and Customers not honouring commitments to purchase
Commodities A and B.
```
```
Entity Z must:
 Manage credit risk while maintaining customer relationships,
 Ensure Customers retain the ability to trade out of their difficulties,
 Find alternate buyers for Commodities A and B, often at short notice,
 Ensure throughput of Commodities A and B, and
 Manage the changing logistics requirements through this event.
```
These three events illustrate Entity Z’s value-added activities for Producer Y in
terms of the following:
 Throughput of volume – shift commodity in market where demand is
weakened.
 Price maximisation – ensure that best price achievable is realised.
 Commodity optimisation – ensure the way that Commodities A and B are
sold to customers is optimal.
 Credit – ensure Commodities A and B are sold to creditworthy Customers
who will not default on payment or delay payment.
 Logistics – ensure that freight is procured effectively and shipping queues
are managed efficiently.

Depending on the contractual terms between Entity Z and Producer Y, and
Entity Z and Customers, Entity Z could take on a number of risks even if it does
not take title to Commodities A and B. For example, inventory, credit and logistic
risks could all be taken on by Entity Z. Depending on the risk assumption
analysis, Entity Z could either assume these risks or perform risk control
functions for these risks.
